# ``StoryKit``

Build rich, data‑driven “choose your own adventure” experiences with a small, composable core and first‑class tooling.

## Overview

StoryKit models interactive stories as graphs of nodes and choices, runs story flow with deterministic, testable state, and provides utilities to author, validate, and package content.

All public symbols are available under the single `StoryKit` module; submodules are re‑exported for convenience.

Author your story as a structure file (JSON) and Markdown text with lightweight section delimiters. Compile to a directory‑based ``StoryBundleLayout`` for distribution.
