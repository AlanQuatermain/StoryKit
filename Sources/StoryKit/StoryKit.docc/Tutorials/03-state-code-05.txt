Library, success path (sanity holds):
You stumble into a small library. The shelves are warped, books swollen with damp. A presence stirs, whispering syllables that scrape against your mind.

The east hallway stretches into a corridor whose length seems inconsistent, as though the house argues with your memory. The boards groan beneath your feet.
