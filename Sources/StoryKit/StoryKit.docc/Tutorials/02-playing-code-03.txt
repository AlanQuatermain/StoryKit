You stand in the foyer of the house on Ash Tree Lane. The wallpaper peels in strips and an unseen draft chills your skin.
1. Go east into the shadowed hall
2. Go west where the floor tilts
3. Go down (the boards feel colder)
4. Ascend the main staircase
Enter choice: 2

The west hallway tilts unnaturally, as though the geometry of the house resists you. A ripple of shadow crawls along the far wall and is gone.
1. Return to the foyer
2. Climb the narrow stair to the attic
Enter choice: 2

The attic is cluttered with rotting trunks and moth-eaten curtains. In the corner lies a heavy tome bound in skin. You open it and feel an almost physical weight pressing on your thoughts, as if the house itself were intruding on your mind.
1. Descend to the west hall
2. Steady yourself and read the tome (Sanity check)
Enter choice: 1
