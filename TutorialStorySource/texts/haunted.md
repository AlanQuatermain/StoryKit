=== node: garden_path ===
The brick path runs straight as a ruler, though roots from the camellias have gently heaved the seams in slow rebellion. A wrought fountain, long dry, wears a rind of lichen like a pilgrim’s cloak. The house ahead watches with its blank, shuttered eyes; even at this distance its symmetry presses on your lungs. Overgrown hedges hold the afternoon’s heat like an oven door left ajar. Sweet, out–of–time jasmine rides the air despite the season—cloying, misremembered, almost medicinal. Your shoes grind grit into the mortar as cicadas drum an arrhythmic under–song, and somewhere a corvid offers a single, indifferent call. You pause and find no neighbors, no carriage or motorcar, no wind to tap the leaves together. It feels as if the property has swallowed sound, as if the garden path is not a walkway but a tongue leading deeper into a mouth.

=== node: study_wax_spill ===
On the blotter’s edge a wax spill has congealed into a topographical map, red sealing wax that ran once and then decided to be a country. A hair is caught in it, a single filament that could belong to anyone and therefore does not belong to you. Pressing the pad of your thumb to the spill releases a faint sweetness under the sharper scent of resin, an echo of letters sealed at a time when privacy was an act and not a setting. The wax yields a little and then refuses, as if guarding the shape of a promise.

=== node: study_chair_castor ===
The desk chair’s castor has worn an oval into the rug, a quiet orbit that records late nights better than any diary. When you roll it, the wheel complains in a register that would shame a violin, then decides to behave with the agreement of a gentleman who knows he is being watched. A single thread winds around the axle like a tiny serpent; you pluck it and it gives with a sound you only hear in memory. Under the chair, the floorboards are bare of dust in a square that reads like a map key.

=== node: study_key_scratch ===
Near the blotter, a scratch in the desktop repeats itself—short, deliberate, parallel—like a key tested and then tested again. The grooves catch light and send it back to your eyes as if asking you to read. You lay your own key beside them, absurd, and find that it does not match; it would be disappointing if it did. In the scratch a mote of something dark glitters, perhaps iron, perhaps old ink, and you let it be because some curiosities deserve their edges.

=== node: dining_decanter_ring ===
On the sideboard a crystal decanter has left a ring that looks like a moon tried herself on the house. The mark glows faintly where polish missed a circle, a halo for spirits gone to better congregations. When you lift the decanter, the ring remains with the stubbornness of belief. The stopper squeaks when you twist it and for a moment you smell a ghost of port that does not care what year anyone claims.

=== node: dining_table_wobble ===
One leg of the long table has taken up a philosophy about impermanence. When you lean, the table answers with a wobble so subtle it feels like hesitation. Beneath the leg, a coin someone once slid to restore order has corroded into the wood, leaving a print of authority that no longer serves. You move your hand and the wobble ceases; you learn not to move your hand.

=== node: foyer_telephone_cradle ===
The telephone on the hall table is a compromise with time: a new voice in an old house. Its cradle shines where anxious fingers have negotiated with operators, and the earpiece smells faintly of shellac and breath. When you lift it, the line is live with a sea of distant conversations, a hush that could be cotton or secrets. You replace it gently, as if the network might bruise.

=== node: nursery_crayon_mark ===
At the baseboard, a crayon has spoken in a language the wall will not scrub entirely away. The color is a red that manufacturers insist is cheerful; here it reads like transcription of a serious event. The line begins confidently and then falters into scribble, a narrative that runs out of plot. You crouch, and the floor obliges your knees with a complaint you pretend not to hear.

=== node: balcony_rain_gutter_seed ===
In the rain gutter a seed has lodged and believed fervently enough to sprout, a green optimism bent at right angles to the house’s opinions. The tiny plant holds a bead of water like a jewel too precious to spend. You pinch the seedling free and set it in soil, a theft for which no one will prosecute you. The gutter reverts to its purpose and you to yours.

=== node: end_madness_11 ===
You follow the cobweb thread because following is easier than choosing. It leads you through the library and then through your own days until the thread becomes thought and the thought becomes the only way to keep from falling. In the end, your fingers move in the air as if pinching something so fine no one else can see it. People learn to step around you in the reading room. The thread hums.

=== node: end_scarred_11 ===
You plant your palm to steady on the gritty balcony and the board repays you with a splinter that outlines itself under the skin like a coastline. Blood arrives politely, then with more ambition. The cut teaches you the body’s curriculum and your body, studious, learns. For weeks, paper snags at the healed place and you remember the view in smaller frames.

=== node: cellar_rug_corner_noise ===
When you lift the pantry rug’s corner, sound changes. The house stops clearing its throat and peers instead. Boards beneath have learned a new dialect; a rattle comes from the nail tin tucked into the joist, as if the tin were a warning bell for a church that meets under the floor. The rug’s backing crackles like dry leaves. You lower it and the sound ends, a door shut without hinges.

=== node: cellar_damp_mark ===
On the pantry wall, waist high, a damp ellipse has bloomed not from a leak but from intention. Touch it and your finger returns with a film that is not water. It smells faintly of stone that has forgotten sunlight. The mark’s lower edge is crisp, like a tide line drew itself and then decided no more.

=== node: cellar_rope_pull ===
A rope disappears through a hole in the floorboards near the back wall, as if the house remembered being a ship. The hemp is smooth where hands taught it lessons and bristled where neglect undid them. You pull; something below nods, a weight acknowledging your existence. You let go, and it returns the courtesy more slowly, the way an old man bows.

=== node: cellar_keyhole_smell ===
The door to the cellar is not quite true in its frame. If you press your nose to the keyhole like a child or a detective, a smell arrives of iron and old soap, lime and the stale breath of candles that would prefer to be bees again. Behind the smell lies a temperature that decides the rest of the house is playing at seasons.

=== node: cellar_air_grate_rust ===
An air grate near the baseboard has lost an argument with the climate. Its slats are furred with rust that reads like frost from a distance. When you graze them with a knuckle, orange dust prints your skin with an alphabet. Through the grate, a draft argues from below in a logic you’ll accept for now.

=== node: cellar_cobweb_skein ===
The corner where wall meets floor is knit with web thick enough to audition as fabric. A silverfish rehearses a line across it and vanishes at a cue you did not hear. When you lift the skein with a pencil, it stretches and fights and then lets go all at once, a small surrender that feels undeserved.

=== node: cellar_floor_chalk ===
Beside the first step, chalk dust has scribed a curve across the boards. It is not the household chalk of a child’s sums; it grits under the nail like powdered shell. Your thumb comes away pale, and the print you leave on your coat looks like a crescent moon that forgot itself.

=== node: cellar_nail_head ===
One nail at the lip of the trapdoor has lifted a hair, an inch toward mutiny. The head is polished where someone pressed it down without tools and made promises with their body heat. You press now. It obeys and then rises back when you look away, a parlor trick the house learned to amuse itself.

=== node: end_madness_9 ===
You listen to the whispers and they listen back; a conversation begins in which you never quite get your turn. Words repeat until they become taste on the tongue and then lose even that dignity. Somewhere above ground the world settles into an evening that will have supper without you. In the silence between silences you hear your own name pronounced in a way that removes it from you permanently. When you climb the stairs, they do not lead where the house keeps its people.

=== node: end_madness_10 ===
You wind the music box again because it seemed polite to accept what it offered, and then again because politeness becomes habit and habit a theology. The tune changes you more than it changes itself. By the third winding, the room’s corners are no longer right angles and the window is not a rectangle but a mouth. You hum and the house hums and between you something else takes up the melody in a key grown in old soil. When you leave, the street does not recognize your name.

=== node: end_scarred_9 ===
The garden’s tunnel, once a gardener’s convenience and later a child’s secret, offers a route the house pretends not to mind. You go to hands and knees. The earth close around ribs is a warning with the courtesy to be soft. Three yards in, a board surrenders under your shoulder with a heart’s sound and the tunnel collapses by inches and then by declaration. You wriggle free into a jasmine that spares the face and spares nothing else. You will find grit in your teeth for a week and a new way to favor your left side in rain.

=== node: end_scarred_10 ===
The first step prides itself on its treachery. Your foot learns this before your mind and you sit down in a hurry on a bone not chosen for sitting. Pain, clear and narrow, draws a line up your spine and writes a single sentence on your breath you will remember a long time. Nothing is broken; something is changed. You will think about railings with more respect for a month.

=== node: landing_newel_cap ===
The newel cap fits the hand like a taught habit. Its varnish has been persuaded into a softness no factory could manage, an achievement of generations’ oils and hesitations before bed. A hairline crack runs along the grain like a map to a place no longer on the railway. When you press a little, the wood gives and returns, a courtesy between old friends. Dust has learned to avoid this spot, as if even in neglect some gestures persist.

=== node: landing_wall_hairline ===
A thread of plaster fracture snakes from the corner of a doorframe toward the ceiling rose with the confidence of ivy. You wet a finger and run it along the line; the moisture vanishes faster than it should, drunk by the wall as though it had a thirst separate from the house. The line widens a whisper near the nursery, then tightens itself as if aware of being watched.

=== node: landing_window_light ===
Light from the stairwell window finds the landing at a particular hour and becomes architecture. It prints the pattern of the muntins across the runner in a grid that briefly outranks the house’s own insistence on order. Dust motes drift like paperwork in a lazy office. In that light, even the scratches at the baseboard look deliberate, like a child’s first ambition.

=== node: landing_floor_creak ===
There is a plank that complains in a tone your ribs answer. It does not object to weight so much as announce presence, a herald more than a guard. You can set your foot at an angle and make the sound pitch down into a confidence or up into a question. The plank prefers confession; you give it one you do not mean.

=== node: landing_stair_shadow ===
On the wall the banister throws a shadow that does not correspond to any light you admit knowing. The rail’s filigree is simpler in shadow, as if the house remembered a plainer version of itself. When you move, the shadow arrives a fraction late, an imprecision that would bother an engineer and delights a poet. You are neither, and you do not say which you prefer.

=== node: landing_air_current ===
Stand still and the landing is airless; take a step and a slender current slips past your wrists like a cat finding your ankles in the dark. Somewhere a door has learned to be almost closed forever. The draft smells of lemon cleaner and a day when the house held more noise than you can imagine. You follow the current until it stops under the nursery door and remember, briefly, the superstition about not waking what sleeps.

=== node: library_globe ===
A floor globe once swaggered here; now it waits like an old captain, faded, with routes drawn in a pen that rusted as it dried. The Atlantic is too green, the deserts too candid. You spin it and it wobbles, its axis a little untrue—nothing in this house is perfectly polar. A fingernail mark near New Orleans suggests a habit of tracing the way home.

=== node: library_fallen_page ===
Between stacks a page has escaped and come to rest half under a shelf, its edges frilled by dust bunnies that look like tropical flora. The text is in French, a polite essay about the impolite nature of chance, margins adorned with dots where someone thought to return and did not. You put it back into a book that seems to accept it the way a sea accepts a bottle.

=== node: library_ink_bottle ===
On a side table an ink bottle holds a skin of black that hasn’t moved in years. Tilt it gently and the skin wrinkles, a miniature geography making mountains of surface tension. The smell that rises is school and argument. A pen nearby wears a nib stained violet by a brief experiment in modernity; it did not take.

=== node: library_window_shutter ===
The interior shutters are a compromise with the sun from an era before electricity felt reliable. Their louvers have learned to listen; they angle themselves to keep secrets and give none away. A sliver of light escapes regardless and draws a blade across the floor that bisects your shoe in gold.

=== node: library_cobweb_thread ===
From the cornice to the bust of a statesman you cannot quickly name runs a single thread of web that has caught precisely one mote, which glows with ecclesiastical authority. You blow and the thread trembles but refuses to release its treasure. The statesman remains unimpressed.

=== node: library_book_dust_smear ===
Along the top of a row of histories someone once drew a finger and then reconsidered, leaving a smear that is half question mark, half admonition. You add a straight line beside it to make an exclamation and immediately regret the grammar. The dust accepts your edit and, for a second, you feel like you have said something worth hearing.

=== node: dining_salt_cellar ===
A pair of salt cellars sit like small temples beside the head of the table. Their glass is cut with a geometry that turns light into a discipline, and the spoons that live with them are silver gone to the first tarnish of regret. One cellar has gathered a little clump where humidity proposed marriage and salt agreed. You press the spoon’s back to it and it breaks with the satisfaction of a rule enforced. The salt smells like the Gulf if you let it, which you do not. A grain sticks to your fingertip and refuses to leave you for a moment longer than it should.

=== node: dining_knife_nick ===
The knife you lift has a nick in its edge the size of a sin a priest would forgive if you were contrite. The mark catches a thumbnail and tells a story of bone or impatience. Its handle is mother-of-pearl fitted to the hand of someone who liked their luxuries close. The blade’s reflection is cloudy, which suits the mirror above the sideboard; you see yourself as the house seems to prefer—present, but negotiable. When you set the knife down, the sound rings a little, as if the table were thinner than it looks.

=== node: dining_lace_runner ===
The lace runner on the table is a river whose banks are logic and whose water is patience. Its pattern repeats in a way that almost convinces you it never will stop, and then it stumbles, once, where a repair doubled a stitch. You lay two fingers on it as one might on a friend’s wrist and feel only fabric and remember the word ‘pulse’ has many meanings. A faint stain near the middle, shaped like a country you could not win a war in, remembers a spill that did not end a friendship.

=== node: dining_place_card ===
Tucked under the edge of a plate is a place card written in a hand that seems incapable of error. The name—first only—belongs to someone you can almost see: the curve of a smile that felt like a win, the slant of a laugh that did not depend on witnesses. The ink has browned and its scent is gone, but the pressure remains in the paper where the pen insisted on itself. You return the card to its hiding place and the room grants you the illusion that you have not changed its arrangement at all.

=== node: parlor_ashtray ===
The ashtray is cut glass, a poor choice for a thing that must be dirtied to be respected. Its facets glower under a dust that once thought itself smoke. A single butt remains, lipstick a color called something like Cerise on its rim, a print of an evening that had creators and critics. The ash, when stirred, gives off a smell that is not tobacco but the ghost of company. You leave it cleaner than you found it and feel this may have been impolite.

=== node: parlor_record_sleeve ===
Near the pianoforte a phonograph’s record sleeve leans under a side table’s shyness. The paper is soft at the corners, and the printed florals have bleached into a palette a designer would call restful to avoid the word ‘faded.’ Inside, the shellac disc waits with grooves like plowed fields. A title in a hand you can almost place—perhaps the house’s young man in 1919—names a fox-trot that made someone’s heart race once. You do not play it, but the room rehearses the dance anyway, small motions in the curtains you cannot swear were wind.

=== node: parlor_rug_corner ===
At the edge of the rug a corner lifts in a rebellion that is neither dramatic nor trivial. The corner shows a tag on its underside with a maker’s mark as proud as a flag, the date half worn away. Dust outlines the absence where the corner usually lies with a fidelity to borders that might have made a judge weep. When you lay it back down it resists, then agrees with the elegance of a person who knows the right time to concede.

=== node: parlor_side_table_book ===
On the side table lies a book left mid-argument. Its spine is cracked where a good sentence broke it, and the ribbon marker rests with a pair of threads out like a serpent’s tongue. When you open, the page exhales a smell of glue and paper and resignation. In the margin a pencil has underlined a phrase about houses and their tempers. You do not take the book with you; you agree with it and put it down.

=== node: garden_gate_creak ===
The smaller gate within the garden fence announces itself with a creak pitched exactly to the note that finds the place between shoulder blades. You push and it sings the same complaint in a higher key, as if hoping to be understood at last. The latch has a trick, and your hand learns it. When you release, the gate stands ajar by a hair, a compromise you can live with.

=== node: garden_lizard_on_wall ===
A green anole does a miracle on the wall: it becomes the exact green of the ivy and then, considering you, becomes the color of bark. Its throat flashes a strawberry flag twice and then folds away. You cannot help but accept the lesson about survival presented with such casual theater. When it goes, it leaves the wall more itself, and you a little less.

=== node: garden_mud_print ===
Near the faucet a print in dried mud shows the outline of a heel and a bit of a sole’s pattern worn nearly smooth. The print is small enough to be a woman’s or a man’s who walks more than he rides. Another print halves it, newer, as if time practiced palimpsest with feet. You set yours beside them and find the measurement unsatisfying in a way that persuades you to move on.

=== node: garden_orange_peel ===
Under the jasmine, a twist of orange peel has kept a color the garden would prefer to own. It has dried into a curl like a cat sleeping, and when you lift it the white pith shows teeth marks that are not rodent. A person stood here and ate and left their sun on the ground. You put the peel back and do not scold the ghost for littering.

=== node: foyer_chandelier_prisms ===
The chandelier over the foyer hangs like a winter evergreen that forgot its season. Each prism is a tear frozen mid-argument, clouded by a film that turns light into a behavior rather than a substance. When you touch one it swings and sets the others to chiming, a choir of glass tongues speaking a language best heard and not translated. Dust has settled into the little brass cups like coins collected for a tithe. At the hub, a pin has been replaced with a nail cut short and filed smooth by someone who intended to be kind to future hands.

=== node: foyer_checkerboard_chip ===
The checkerboard floor wears its age honestly; one tile near the stair has lost a chip like a crescent moon peeling away from a planet. The break reveals a layer of mortar the color of old teeth. You kneel and touch the edge and the tile answers with a cold that climbs the fingers and announces itself to the wrist as if the house prefers to be known bone-first. The black squares reflect the chandelier’s ghosts; the white squares record your breath in small, temporary fogs.

=== node: foyer_umbrella_stand ===
The stand beside the door is an iron hoop with pretensions to vine. It holds no umbrellas but remembers them; the ring of rust on the floor is a negative of faithful companionship. At the bottom a single ferrule cap has fallen asleep, brass dented by a fall that the umbrella probably forgave. You lift the stand and discover beneath it a perfect circle of dust like a lunar phase that waited politely for inspection. When you replace it, the circle remains, an honest witness.

=== node: foyer_knocker_lion ===
From the inside, you consider the lion’s head that decided to be the house’s handshake. Through the glass its bronze muzzle watches the garden’s faint light as if deciding whether to roar or purr. The ring it grips shows flat spots where a century’s worth of callers declared themselves, an erosion as personal as the softening of a wedding band. If you lay your knuckles against the wood near it, you feel the house’s pulse slow and unapologetic: a heart that knows it is made of rooms.

=== node: foyer_tile_hairline ===
Near the foot of the stairs a hairline cracks a tile so finely that only certain angles and a deliberate patience make it confess itself. The line changes direction twice in a way that suggests a child’s game; you trace it and find your finger obliged to turn where you wish it would not. The crack stops short of the grout as if it repented. Dust gathers along it like a pencil line drawn by a bashful ghost.

=== node: foyer_coat_tree ===
The coat tree has no coats but many hooks, each polished to a small mirror by sleeves and hands and the second thoughts of guests who chose not to hang what they carried. A hatpin once made a tiny murder here; the wound in the wood is clean and dark and oddly proud. When you touch the top finial, it warms as if pretending to be a living thing accepting your introduction.

=== node: garden_ivy_trellis ===
Ivy has learned to write on the trellis, curling cursive that spells nothing and everything, vowels that decide to be consonants and are forgiven. A small bird has drawn a house among the stems and fled months ago; its absence has the shape of a presence if you stare long enough. When you brush the leaves, a powder the color of late afternoon coats your fingertips with a secret that will not last until supper.

=== node: garden_gate_chain ===
The chain that can close the garden walk is looped over a hook and sits like a necklace that knows it is not decoration. Spots of orange invite the eyes to imagine tetanus; the hook replies with a stubborn shine. A small scrap of ribbon—once red, now argument-colored—has been tied to the chain and forgotten, a flag for a country that never fielded an army.

=== node: garden_shell_path ===
The shell path talks when you walk it, the way old friends do when they have no new business but will not be quiet for politeness. Crushed oyster and clam shine up like coins that remember the ocean. You pause and the path continues the conversation a moment longer before admitting it was always your steps making the words.

=== node: garden_cicada_shells ===
On the bark of a crepe myrtle, a dozen cicada shells cling at child height—first trophies from summers that took themselves seriously. The shells are a pale amber, delicate and preposterous. When you lift one free, it weighs nothing but intention. You set it on the wall, a parade of absence facing the house.

=== node: garden_wrought_iron ===
The fence along the walk curls into patterns that pretend to be restraint and succeed. Your fingers find pocks where rain wrote its own commentary on human will. At one upright, initials have been carved into paint with the point of a key: two letters and a plus sign that felt like a promise on an afternoon when the river showed off and the heat forgave everything. Rust has made the letters into a relief map of a nation that fell before it formed.

=== node: garden_ant_mound ===
An ant mound at the edge of the bed rises like a city that built itself and then published the plans in sand-colored paper. The ants stream in two directions like prayers and their attention to work is a rebuke or a comfort depending on what you brought with you today. When you kneel, they edit your shadow with swift, unanimous votes.

=== node: arrival_road ===
The road that carries you out from New Orleans narrows until it becomes a thought more than a plan. In 1927 the city is a fever of jazz and cranes and confidence, but the road learns humility as it leaves the last streetcar bell behind. Cypress and live oak close ranks overhead, their beards of Spanish moss hanging in drapes that remember both weddings and wakes. Water is everywhere and nowhere—ditches glint dull pewter, a hidden canal whispers its breadth with a single ripple, and the air itself feels like a warm mouth. Cicadas lay down a rhythm section somewhere you cannot see. Your motorcar coughs once at the turn you were told to look for and then assents, tires grumbling over packed shell that crunches like new snow under city shoes. 

You are not a superstitious person; the title on your desk that reads “Associate—Real Estate” is a communion wafer against such indulgences. And yet you can name every superstition in a two-parish radius, because ink is not the only thing that keeps houses upright. You have the key the solicitor pressed into your palm, heavy as an argument. You have the papers that will turn grief into property in a hand that will not shake. The name on the deed is Delacroix—as old a name as the river’s bend—and you have heard it your entire life in stories told by people with good hats and people with none at all. Eulalie Delacroix is newly dead of a heart that stopped politely in its sleep, and you have been sent to see whether the house that outlived her will behave for the living. 

Ahead, through a curtain of trees gone sullen in the heat, masonry interrupts the green with the confidence of old money. You taste metal and sugar from the refinery downwind and something else, a mineral note that does not belong to any industry you can name. You slow without deciding to, as though the car understands that the house you will meet has opinions about arrivals and likes them unhurried.

=== node: arrival_gate ===
The double gate is set back from the road in a way that announces privacy and the leisure that pays for it. Wrought iron curls into a calligraphy that does not bother to spell anything—an alphabet of flourishes that might as well be the family itself. On one post a brass plate delivers the single word DELACROIX in letters that have learned to stand at attention without effort. The latch is not locked and yet it resists like a hand that knows you by description but not by sight. Humidity clings to your cuffs; your collar argues with your throat. In the ditches on either side, frogs consider you with the patience of bailiffs. 

You park just inside, conscious of the two-hundred and fifty yards of no neighbors displayed like a certificate. Beyond the gate the driveway is not grand—no allee of oaks, no drama—just a shell path that has known more hoofbeats than rubber. Gardens occupy themselves in the dignified neglect of two months without a gardener: jasmine ranges past its taught boundaries; crape myrtle throws blooms like a loose woman throws glances; a pot has toppled and found that gravity is a lover worth keeping. The house stands beyond, not a plantation house and not a townhouse but something Creole in its bones—a late 18th-century body with a Greek Revival coat over its shoulders, tall windows like solemn eyes, a balcony ironwork that pretends to lace. 

=== node: arrival_path ===
You pass through the gate and the air changes the way it does when a church takes you in. The path leads through a front garden stitched with narrow beds and a geometry of hedges gone soft at the corners. Shell crunches underfoot like the sound of a letter being opened. On a low wall someone once kept terracotta soldiers to guard the rosemary; they have fallen in slow motion, their beheadings genteel, the thyme indifferent to their sacrifice. The humidity is an extra jacket you cannot shrug off; the sky is a pewter lid with no promise in it. 

The house’s facade is plain for a building that has survived so many fashions. You see the deep porch that keeps rain honest, the shutters that insist on privacy in a climate that never did. You remember what you were told: the Delacroix line planted here when Spain still held conversations with France, and they stayed while flags changed and the river did what the river always does. The family is a map of that loyalty: births and marriages; a son who left for St. Louis and wrote letters until the letters forgot him; a daughter who never left and cultivated both orchids and grudges. 

=== node: arrival_front_door ===
The doors are double and big enough to imply guests who never had to knock. Their paint has the depth of a good piano, and the brass of the knocker is worn in a place that corresponds exactly to a thumb, though you may be the first hand upon it in sixty days. A bell pull dangles beside it like a length of muscle; a telephone line coils down the wall and disappears into a box that belongs to the present and looks apologetic for the fact. Under the porch the air is a little cooler, a little closer. You can hear the house breathing through vents discreetly cut long ago, as if the place is dieting on smaller sips of air until it learns your schedule. 

You straighten your tie you did not need to wear. You inventory yourself the way you inventory rooms: pen, notebook, key that bites the palm, a curious courage. Somewhere in the garden a cicada throws itself into a cadenza and then decides to live. You could circle the house once before knocking; you could take the porch’s mercy and go straight in. The gate behind you is not locked, which is not the same as being open.

=== node: master_valise_lock ===
Under the window a leather valise waits with the patience of luggage that knows it will be asked to forgive. Its brass lock bears a scar where a key turned with indignation rather than love. When you lift the hasp, it does not open but it does permit you to hear the suitcase breathe—air sighing along a seam that had resigned itself to quiet. The handle’s stitching has let go in one place and been repaired with thread too pale for the leather, a bandage that boasts its own virtue. You smell camphor and the ghost of a perfume that answers to no fashionable decade. Inside, you imagine a silk lining faded into the color of arguments.

=== node: master_bedpost_knot ===
One of the bedposts wears a knot of ribbon beneath its fluting, not decorative but practical, a sailor’s half-remembered hitch. The ribbon is gray with the room’s seasons and the tails are uneven by a certainty only human hands achieve. When you tug, the knot tightens the smallest amount and then refuses, announcing a limit you respect. Dust has collected along the ribbon’s edge in a line so sharp it looks deliberate, a ledger of days counted without malice. A scratch beneath the knot suggests the ribbon was added to hide a wound, wood beneath nicked where metal kissed it too fiercely.

=== node: master_window_latch ===
The master window admits the same argument the house has with air on every floor, but here the latch pretends to arbitrate. Its brass is thinned where fingers negotiated across years, an economy of touch that leaves a thumbprint in metal no police could live with. When you turn it, the window lifts a fraction and a cooler layer of night flows past your face, smelling faintly of jasmine and of something tidal though the river is blocks away. The sash complains in a note the balcony knows. Beyond, the garden is a darker geometry, resolute and secretive.

=== node: master_fire_screen ===
The fire screen is embroidered with a pastoral that cannot mind the irony of living in a room where winter is forbidden. Stags browse beside a river that looks like stitchwork water until you see the thread’s sheen and cannot think of thirst without thinking of silk. A patch on the lower corner is executed in a different hand—tighter, more doctrinaire—over a scorch mark that tells its own cautionary tale. When you move the screen, the hearth gives up a teaspoon of ash that clings to your cuffs with the entitlement of ancient things.

=== node: balcony_downspout_rattle ===
A downspout affixed to the balcony’s edge keeps up a commentary in the least breeze, a rattle that could be nuts in a child’s pocket or a pilgrim’s bones in a reliquary depending on your education. The strap that holds it has been tightened with wire when a screw surrendered, and the wire has found a new religion in rust. When you lay a finger along the pipe, the vibration travels into your finger and then into your wrist, and for a moment you are nothing but a conduit for weather.

=== node: balcony_floor_grit ===
The floorboards out here have acquired a skin of grit that turns certain steps into counsel. Sand from a stormed planter and paint that remembers last season gather in drifts against the door’s threshold. You draw a line in it with your toe and the line holds like a decision. Between boards, a seed husk sits so perfectly you suspect it was placed. You do not look over the rail; you look at your shoes and the ancient bargain they make with friction.

=== node: balcony_shutter_hinge ===
The shutter hinge has taught itself to sing one note very well. When you push, the sound lifts from metal into the air and remains there, suspended, as a taste rather than a tone. The paint around the strap has curdled into a topography of neglect. You imagine the hinge in storms, flexing to a rhythm the parlor’s lamps never learned, and understand the wood’s complaint even if you don’t approve of its volume.

=== node: bedroom_a_quilt_patch ===
The quilt at the bed’s foot is a treaty among exhausted fabrics. Here a piece of a dress that remembered church; there a square cut from a flour sack printed with a mill’s guarantees. One patch has been replaced inexpertly with a heart, an optimistic choice stitched with the stubbornness of someone who didn’t know the word ‘ornamental’ could be pejorative. Under your hand, the batting has shifted into small continents that do not line up with the surface countries. You lift a corner and a thread travels, a tiny migration you stop with a thumb.

=== node: bedroom_a_floor_scuff ===
The floor between the bed and the dresser shows a path sanded by years of soft shoes. At its center a darker scuff confesses to a moment of haste: a heel caught at the edge of a rug once, a damasked curse, a hand steadying on a bureau. You step there and hear the board complain, a healthy little talk that manages to be both reproach and invitation. Your own foot maps its way into the scuff like a key finding a lock it wishes were its own.

=== node: bedroom_a_mirror_fleck ===
The mirror over the dresser has a constellation of silver flecks along its edge that turns faces into weather when the light is wrong. You lean in and your eye becomes a coastline. In the varnish of the frame, a hair is caught and preserved, a delicate fossil of an ordinary morning. The smell here is powder and lemon oil and the afterthought of tobacco. When you draw a finger along the frame’s beading, dust arranges itself into a straight line that never existed without your intervention and will not exist long.

=== node: bedroom_b_frame_wire ===
Behind a picture you lifted earlier, the wire is a twisted braid that has been tightened twice, two histories in a single tension. The hooks in the wall are the kind a careful person installs and a tired person forgets—stout, trustworthy, given to complaining when their duty is ignored. The paper backer bears a pencil note in a hand that could be a child’s or a surgeon’s: ‘left of center’ with an arrow that points everywhere and nowhere. You hang the frame again and feel the wall accept it with a sound you do not register until it ceases.

=== node: bedroom_b_shoebox_ribbon ===
At the back of the wardrobe a shoebox rests beneath companions that forgot it. The lid is tied with a ribbon the color of a bruise at its radical middle, and the knot has been pulled and retied until the ribbon’s edge has learned to fray in self-defense. When you loosen it, the box inhales, suggesting a previous life in which it stored better promises. Inside, tissue paper clings to itself with a sound like rain on paper roofs. You do not go further. You retie the ribbon, leave the knot slightly more honest than you found it, and close the door on a smell of old leather and older paper.

=== node: catacombs_skull_niche ===
A shallow niche in the wall holds a skull whose patience has outlasted at least three different arrangements of candles. Wax has run and cooled and run again in tiers like geological strata, each layer a color that announces a season or a mood—beeswax honey, tallow pearl, a thin sacrificial black that drank a wick too fast. The skull’s left orbit holds a pebble that fits too neatly to be chance. If you touch the bone, it is not cold; it is the temperature of the room as if it belongs here more than you do. A line scored beneath the niche in a tidy hand names a year that would make no sense above ground.

=== node: catacombs_chalk_arrow ===
On the stone at shin height someone has drawn an arrow with chalk that survived a generous humidity by stubbornness alone. The head points toward a turn that your instincts would have mistrusted, which perhaps is why the arrow exists: to train second thoughts. The tail is smudged by a boot or a hem, but you can see, along one edge, the ridges left by the chalk’s paper wrapper, a brand remembered by stone. You could add your own mark beside it and you do not, a courtesy to others you will never meet.

=== node: catacombs_drip_pit ===
Here the ceiling has chosen a spot to study you. A single drip forms with liturgical patience and falls into a bowl hollowed over years into the floor. The pit is not deep but it is committed. Around it the stone has blushed into mineral blooms that look like feathers or frost depending on what your hands have done that day. When the drop falls, it makes the smallest possible sound with the greatest possible conviction. You crouch to peer into the water and the face that regards you is yours and someone else’s, neither of you ready to admit it.

=== node: catacombs_air_shaft ===
Above, a seam opens into something like sky. The air is clearer here, cool with a promise that has nothing to do with mercy. You lift your headlamp and find the shaft’s walls furred with roots so fine they could be hair—white, reaching in all directions with the wild optimism of plants that have never seen the sun. A square of brightness far above insists there is a world. You listen for street sounds and hear only the house breathing in the particular way it reserves for the places it has forgotten to inventory.

=== node: catacombs_broken_cart ===
Against a wall collapsed into suggestion lies the wheel of a cart, spoke snapped, rim bit by rust into a lace the Victorians would have wept over. The iron smells like blood never touched it and yet cannot stop telling you otherwise. In the hub, a wasp nest that never knew a wasp perches like an architectural model abandoned by a firm that folded at the first sign of winter. A curl of leather strap remains, brittle and proud. You imagine someone blessing the cart’s failure for saving a back and cursing it for delaying anything that cannot afford delay in a place like this.

=== node: catacombs_lime_heap ===
In one corner, a heap of lime glows where other whites in the world would have the decency to dull themselves with dust. It remembers an intention you’d prefer not to interrogate. When you stir it with a fragment of bone that is no longer proprietary about its purpose, the powder collapses into a dune and releases a smell like old mortar and new secrets. Your breath draws it; you hold still until the air forgets you again. Footprints in and out of the heap have blurred into a general confession.

=== node: catacombs_rune ===
Carved into a pillar is a mark you almost know. It might be a letter fancy enough to be a symbol or a symbol humble enough to be a letter. The chisel went in at a hesitating angle and then decided to be sure of itself. Dust has collected in the cuts in a way that makes the strokes fresher than the stone, a paradox that settles if you accept that time has different salaries in different rooms. When you trace it—of course you do—the groove insists your finger is larger than the finger that made it.

=== node: catacombs_rat_nest ===
The nest is built of shredded paper that once petitioned a clerk with respectable margins, of hair, of threads from a dress that was not done being a dress. It is warmer than the air around it in the way of industrious things. A single bead—glass, blue, vulgar in a saintly way—winks from the wall like an unrehearsed contrition. When you lean close, the nest hums without inhabitants, a trick of your blood deciding it would prefer a different house.

=== node: catacombs_bone_pile ===
The bones arranged here have been sorted by an amateur with time. Long bones in one stack, a confetti of phalanges in a shallow niche, vertebrae like coins spilling from a failed pocket. None are clean; each carries a film of the room that will never wash. Someone has tied two tibiae with twine in a cross that will make sense to a certain sort of story and to no one’s mother. You cannot help but look for a skull and are obliged by one that appears last, as a punchline.

=== node: catacombs_stale_air ===
Here the air does not move unless you teach it. When you fan your hand, the torch’s flame leans and then, wounded, stands back up. The taste is chalk and the metallic throb of old water. Your mind supplies voices because silence this complete is a theater that demands actors. The corridor ahead yawns the way a mouth does when the body it belongs to has decided not to speak.

=== node: catacombs_scratch_tally ===
Five-counts cut into a low stone form a ledger no accountant would bless but all of them would recognize. The tallies end abruptly after a group of three, a line begun and aborted, the promise of five withheld. The scratches are fresh enough that grit rests along their rims like salt on the edge of a glass. You put your thumbnail in one and it finds purchase. Nothing in the catacomb changes at that provocation and somehow that is worse.

=== node: kitchen_saucepan_patina ===
Saucepans hang from a rail like moons in phases, each with a patina that is less stain than biography. One has a pearly bloom on its copper belly where someone used an anxious hand and Bon Ami to the point of prayer; another is lacquered with the memory of milk gone ambitious. When you lift one down, the hook complains in a pitch that makes you think of teeth. The inside surface, stroked by a cloth and insisted at by years, gleams in a way that is not pride so much as surrender. When you set it on the range unlit, it holds your breath in its lip for a blink before releasing it in a sigh you pretend not to notice.

=== node: kitchen_bread_crumbs ===
On the cutting board a drift of crumbs has arranged itself according to currents you cannot feel. Among them sits an oval of butter paper, translucent where someone pressed a finger to hold it against a knife. A ridge runs across the board’s grain where the knife always halted and turned back, the daily tide of breakfast marking time more honestly than clocks. You collect a few crumbs with a forefinger and they compress into a pellet with more elasticity than stale bread should own. The smell is wheat and salt and a ghost of yeast that has opinions about the hour.

=== node: kitchen_cutting_board_groove ===
The board itself is a topography of patience. Parallel grooves move in from the edges like contour lines toward a mountain that never quite rises. Within the oldest cuts are darker veins of something that was once juice and is now theology. At the far end, a notch has been carved deliberately: a gutter that lets liquids escape into a bowl that isn’t there, an innovation borne of mess. You press your palm flat and feel how the wood archived hands larger and smaller than yours; for a second, the board makes your fingers part to fit a memory not yours.

=== node: kitchen_window_screen ===
The screen keeps out what the house no longer wishes to enumerate. Its mesh is a lace of intentions that have held against moth and wasp and the blown grit of hot months. Here and there the wires have broken and been worried back into place with the tip of a knife, improvisations that work as well as faith. Beyond, the garden is a painting by a realist with a hangover; its colors approximate, its lines stubborn. A fly walks the screen’s geometry with the conviction of a surveyor while your breath fogs briefly and your face becomes a rumor in the wire.

=== node: kitchen_warmth_pipe ===
A small pipe shouldering out of the wall runs warm, not hot, as if it carried not steam but the memory of it. When your knuckles hover near, the air is delicious in a cruel way, a winter benevolence in a summer room. The paint is the pale green of operating rooms, a color chosen by someone who believed in modernity while standing in an old house. A polished ellipse where a back leaned and waited refuses to take new dust and so outlines a person who no longer lives here. You stand in that shape a moment and discover your patience is shorter than theirs.

=== node: kitchen_broom_corn ===
The broom stands inverted in the corner, bristles up like a harvest bouquet. Each corn straw ends in a whisper of broken fibers that tickle if you dare them. The twine binding shows a second knot added later by a hand less confident than the first. When you lift the broom, a cone of dust remains that holds its form like a small volcano until someone’s breath asks it a question and it fails politely. A black hair catches in the binding and writes a letter you do not recognize along the handle’s length.

=== node: pantry_spice_tins ===
Spice tins keep their own parliament on a shelf. Paprika’s red lid sits beside cinnamon’s brown as if two ministers were waiting to disagree. When you open one, the scent that rises is sharp and precise, carrying the memory of kitchens that welcomed guests through hunger first and opinion second. A thin line of rust connects lid to body where steam found the seam and made itself at home. On the underside of one lid, someone has chalked a fraction—half? quarter?—a reminder that will not help anyone but the hand that wrote it.

=== node: pantry_sugar_sack ===
The sack of sugar slumps with the indolence of a god between sacrifices. Its paper is soft as old money and bears fingerprints in negative where flour-dusted hands moved it ritualistically from shelf to table and back. A corner has burst and been mended with two neat pins that will later find their way to someone’s foot. You pinch a little and it squeaks between finger and thumb, fine as gossip. When you lick the dust from your knuckle, the sweetness is a violence you forgive.

=== node: pantry_mouse_hole ===
At the floor’s edge a hole breaks the baseboard’s republic, a small dark republic of its own. Around it the wood bears rub marks like the polish of boots against a threshold reduced to whisker-level. A few droppings sit with the dignity of punctuation; someone laid down a trap once and thought better in the next instant, or forgot. You kneel and the hole breathes a coolness that implies a network of confidences under the house. You breathe back and hope diplomacy is possible.

=== node: pantry_jar_lids ===
The glass jars wear their zinc lids like modest hats. Some are stamped with the names of cities, itinerant objects that chose this pantry as their retirement. One lid does not match its jar and makes a protest in the form of a wobble so slight it only registers as irritation. When you press it down, it burps the faintest breath of vinegar—the kind that carries summer’s cucumbers through a winter that refuses to yield. The rings bear teeth marks of a wrench or a hand that decided to become a wrench because supper was waiting.

=== node: pantry_cobweb_bead ===
Between two shelves a cobweb carries a bead of water like a jewel on parade, refusing to fall until physics writes it a letter. When you blow, it trembles but does not go; the spider knows something you do not about tension. The web has collected a confetti of spice dust that makes it read like a banner for a parade that never happened. The bead elongates and releases at last, landing on your wrist cool as permission.

=== node: pantry_rug_edge ===
The rug at the pantry’s center arrests the eye with its ordinary blue, which is how rugs like to be useful. At one edge the binding has frayed into tassels that point, coincidentally or devoutly, toward the board that lifts to reveal the cellar entrance. If you toe the fringe aside, you see the head of a nail that listens for reasons to rise. The rug carries a print where something heavy once rested, a rectangle that could be a crate or a box that held promises the house never intended to keep.

=== node: nursery_music_box ===
The music box is no larger than a fist and heavier than your memory of such things. Painted flowers have chipped to show tin beneath, and the ballerina on its lid has lost one arm but not her commitment to the pose. When you wind it, the key resists exactly where you expect and then submits with a moral you understand too well. The tune that spills is familiar from afternoons of enforced napping and the smell of talc. Halfway through the melody, a note arrives that does not belong and yet insists. You feel the room tilt toward that wrongness, as if a child had hummed along alone for too long and taught the box a new refrain. The cradle answers with a creak too regular to be the house.

=== node: nursery_doll_eye ===
On the shelf a porcelain doll practices stillness with professional skill. Her eyes are the kind that close when laid down, except one sticks. The unblinking pupil reflects the window and you and something that may be a cloud and may be a hand. You lift the doll, and dust that remembers gloves rises. Under the dress’s hem, the stitches along one seam are larger, more urgent, as if a repair were made between breaths. A single hair, not a child’s, lies trapped beneath the varnish of one eye like a fossilized lash. When you set her back, her head finds a new angle that allows her to supervise the room with improved authority.

=== node: nursery_stuffed_hare_seam ===
The stuffed hare has been loved in the cruel way children love with their whole hands. One ear is velvet smooth and nearly bald; the other remembers a winter of neglect. Along the belly, a seam has been picked and resewn in haste with thread darker than the original. When you press there, the body answers with a crunch not of cotton but of paper folded small and patient. You do not cut; instead you knead until the paper shifts and resettles, this time nearer the chest. Somewhere, the wallpaper’s hares tilt an ear, listening. You place the toy so it faces the window, a kindness against which it cannot argue.

=== node: nursery_window_rattle ===
When the window rattles, it is not wind; the day outside is laid like a pressed flower. The sash lifts a fraction anyway and the room inhales a thin ribbon of air that smells of rain farther away than today. The latch, loose on one screw, trembles in a way that would annoy a nurse and comfort a child. A moth the color of paper consults the pane and cannot agree with itself whether to live here. In the rattle’s cadence, you hear a phrase repeated—two short, one long—until the pattern becomes a request you cannot translate without inventing a language.

=== node: nursery_chalk_dust ===
On the little slate at the table, a sum waits patiently: three and two making a number crossed out and replaced by the same number. Chalk dust halos the arithmetic like pollen. You drag a finger through it and leave a moon that travels across your fingertip until it lands on your coat. A stub of chalk lies beside the slate with a bitten end; someone once found calculation unappetizing. When you lift the slate, the impression of letters from the previous lesson ghosts across the board, a primer in a different hand, lines that curl into a script you would swear was not your alphabet at all.

=== node: nursery_drawer_sachet ===
The drawer in the small dresser drags as if reluctant to deliver what it has guarded. Inside, folded garments live their tidy afterlife, and between them a sachet stitched with three uneven daisies persists in its project. The scent—lavender, a little dusty—rises and becomes your grandmother’s hallway for an instant and then fails, dropping you back into this room. The sachet has been opened and resewn with stitches shorter than the bag’s originals; within, something rattles that is not herb. You do not take it apart. You put it back where it can continue to argue against mildew and grief.

=== node: study_letter_opener ===
The letter opener is shaped like a sword that pretends it is not proud of the fact. Its blade is mother-of-pearl that has lost its nacre where a thumb worked it year after year. The handle bears an initial pounded in by someone with less sense than force, and the edge has been honed by the wrong stones, leaving it keen only in certain moods. You balance it on your finger and it tips toward the correspondence tray as if magnetized. A ghost of old glue at the hilt suggests it once accompanied a scabbard lost to a move or to a hasty decision.

=== node: study_stamp_album ===
Under a stack of almanacs hides an album of stamps fastened with thread like the spine of a small animal. Pages crackle when you turn them, and each little country declares its face with colors that have not faded as much as their governments. In a margin, a set of pencil ticks counts arrivals that never reached the hinge. One stamp is missing, but its gum residue remains, sticky in a way that insists it is recent, which it cannot be. A faint perfume clings between two pages—not flowers, but a ghost of glue—an adhesive politeness that smiles and lies.

=== node: study_desk_secret_compartment ===
The desk’s knee space holds a stretcher bar joined with a dovetail that is too clean for its neighbors. When you press there, the drawer above jumps a fraction and a panel inside gives with the reluctance of a confession. The cavity is shallow, designed for things that wish to be found by someone who already knows. Inside: a stub of candle that smells of tallow, a button that belongs to a coat richer than the study deserves, and a strip of paper bearing four numbers that want to be a lock. When you close it, the desk swallows with a small wooden throat.

=== node: study_typewriter_keys ===
The typewriter sits like a small building with its own roof and windows. Keys bear letters worn into ovals by purpose; the ‘E’ has been asked for more than its share and complains now by sticking at the top of its arc. When you press, the bar rises and kisses the ribbon with a little indignation. In the platen’s margin, someone has typed a single name over and over and then fed the paper through again to obliterate the name with the next. The rhythm that remains under your fingertips is pleasing and terrible, a metronome a person could live their life by without ever noticing the cost.

=== node: study_envelope_scent ===
A stack of envelopes, unused, waits like little houses hoping for occupants. The paper is laid, faintly ribbed, and the gum on the flaps tastes medicinal when you indulge a childish curiosity. On one corner, pressed in by a thumb, the shape of a seal shows through—no wax, just pressure remembered by fiber. If you hold the stack to your face, the scent that rises is not lavender or lemon oil but something drier and sharper that reminds you of a chemist’s shop. You picture a letter written with the discipline of someone who knows which words keep people alive.

=== node: study_curtain_hem ===
The study’s curtains do not invite inspection and are a little offended when they receive it. Along the hem, a line of stitches marches without the machine’s smug regularity—a person did this and learned by doing. One stitch is larger where a thought interrupted a hand. In the puckered fabric, a single long hair has been captured like a river in satin. When you pull the curtain aside, light sifts dust into columns that look like a cathedral seen after standing too quickly. The window reminds you of the house’s other windows and their lies, and you let the fabric fall back into its stern grace.

=== node: end_madness_7 ===
It begins with a hush you think is kindness. You hum to meet it, a childhood pattern meant to calm a fretful room, and the tune comes back to you wrong by one note. Your throat adjusts like a mirror blaming the face above it, and soon you are singing to match the house’s pitch. Walls soften into curtains that stir without wind; the floor tilts the slightest degree toward a center that is not the staircase and not any human point. Voices join that are only yours shaved thin and layered until they become choir. The cradle rocks somewhere it cannot be seen and yet is under your hands. When the door opens to let you out hours later, you step into a street with the sun in a position that will never be noon again, and you cannot say what the day is called. You move through a world that will not agree to a single name.

=== node: end_madness_8 ===
At the library’s threshold you whisper a name to test the way syllables carry, and the name returns loyal and docile. You try another, not yours, and hear a yawning under the floorboards like a book opening in a language that remembers you from before your schooling. The shelves tilt almost invisibly. You hold a volume at chest height and the text swims forward as if your eyes were a current; letters eddy and braid into new obligations until you understand that the order they offer is not the order you can survive. A sensible person would leave. You place your hand on the bookplate and say the house’s motto. The response climbs the stairs toward you, hands on both sides of the rail at once. When they reach your face, they are empty of touch. You spend the remainder of the evening practicing the new alphabet on your tongue until the old one will not wake.

=== node: end_scarred_7 ===
You lower yourself to the balcony’s ledge because the ledge promises an angle the stairs will not. The garden is only a story below if you can trust the bushes to remember their duty. Your shoes find purchase on a pattern of ironwork meant for roses; something bites your ankle in a way that tells of teeth long removed from any jaw. You commit. The landing is a negotiation that honors neither of you. Your left knee loses; your right shoulder insists it will not rotate that way again. You roll to a halt in ivy that will require a friend to pick from your coat weeks hence. When you stand, the house appears taller than it was and the street farther. A ringing stays in one ear and turns all polite conversations into questions you cannot answer without wincing.

=== node: end_scarred_8 ===
You tell yourself that a cautious nudge of the boiler’s lever will prove a hypothesis about pressure and its obedience. The metal answers with a ribbon of steam that makes a violin of your skin’s nerves. Pain is not a new language but it is efficient. You leap backward and the slick floor arranges a dance you do not know; your elbow learns concrete and teaches the lesson to your spine in one sharp lecture. The hiss becomes laughter only because your breath is doing a thing it does when it needs you to survive first and think later. You climb the stairs with your mouth tasting of iron and something chemical, bearing a burn that will map itself into your future like a coastline you will learn not to cross at night.

=== node: master_headboard_initials ===
At the top of the bed, two initials have been carved so lightly into the wood that only a certain light will teach them to you. They are ordinary letters that mean nothing without agreement, and you do not have the parties here to sign that agreement. A nick interrupts one stroke, a hesitation or a regret. The grain drinks your fingertip’s oil and darkens by a shade, making the letters bolder for the space of a breath. A strand of hair is caught in a seam of the carving, locked there as if included in the christening. When you step back, the initials vanish and the headboard is whole, a respectable surface that would swear on a Bible it has never been touched by a knife.

=== node: master_lamp_switch ===
Beside the bed the switch for the gas sconce persists as a polite liar. It has been converted to electric and yet the knurled knob remembers the shape of a flame and your hand remembers that it once controlled something that could betray oxygen. You turn it. The bulb obliges with a light the color of the inside of a pearl, and the silk shade replies with small constellations of moth-bites you had not seen in daylight. The knob stops with a notch that implies a second position that does not exist anymore. When you turn past it, the room gives a slight sigh, as if pleased to be asked for something it cannot grant.

=== node: master_mirror_scratch ===
The long mirror in the wardrobe door has a scar that begins at a height consistent with a shoulder and runs down like a stream into winter. The silvering at its edges has retreated in little capes of mercury, and your face floats among cloudbanks that are not yours. You tilt the mirror and the scratch becomes a horizon, imperfect and yet convincing. A residue at the wooden lip smells faintly of vinegar and newspaper ink, the old school of housekeeping. When you exhale, the glass blooms and erases you, the only kindness a mirror can offer.

=== node: master_sheet_hem ===
Someone hemmed these sheets by hand when the world was slower or more urgent. The stitch varies within the space of a hand’s span, as if a second person took over mid-seam or the same person had to stand to answer a bell. Along the hem, a place where thread was tied off and clipped leaves two tails like quotation marks. You press your thumb to them and feel them as individual answers. The linen smells of sunlight held in a chest too long and of lavender that refused to die politely. When you lift the sheet, the mattress whispers a secret you do not immediately understand and then will not be able to forget.

=== node: master_floorboard_give ===
Near the wardrobe a board offers a courtesy it cannot afford: it gives a fraction and then takes back, like a loan whose terms are not kind. When you test it again, the give relocates to the next board over, the way a lie moves in good company. The sound is a syllable you would not have expected wood to know. A seam has caught dust in a line so clean it looks like a pencil’s work, but the dust is cold and tastes of lime when you lift it with a fingertip to convince yourself it is. There is something underneath, and it knows you know it.

=== node: landing_picture_rail_dust ===
The picture rail runs the corridor like a horizon inside the house, and the dust that perches there is an archivist. Where a frame once hung, the rail is clean by a finger’s width, and beside it are two faint ovals where hooks made their little planets. If you stand at the right angle the absence becomes an image: a man turned away or a tree in the wind, depending on your disposition that hour. You can almost feel the sway of a frame lifting from the hook, the weight leaving the wall with the sound of an abrupt decision.

=== node: landing_runner_tack ===
The carpet runner is held by brass tacks that have learned to shine no matter who looks and no matter the decade. One tack, two risers up, is not like its brothers. It has been lifted and set again at an angle that does not respect its regiment. The head bears a triangle of damage as if a small chisel taught it a sharp lesson. Beneath the tack the runner shows a darker lozenge that argues strongly for the presence of something beneath the stair at one time. When you press your foot there, the stair answers with a sound like a hand not quite clapping.

=== node: landing_baluster_wobble ===
A single baluster confesses loyalty to a different gravity. When you test it, it moves—a soft, scandalized sway that would never show itself to company. The mortise has loosened and been persuaded back with a shim of paper printed with a date that is both far away and near, depending on which politics you remember. You leave it better than you found it and the rail thanks you with a polish that transfers to your palm like a secret handshake.

=== node: landing_sun_bleach ===
The sun knows this landing better than some of its occupants did. A pale rectangle on the floorboards marks where a rug once lay through long mornings, protecting the wood from the river of light. In its corners, dust has turned to felt. You move through the rectangle and your shadow becomes part of the geometry that kept time here when the clock refused to be trusted.

=== node: landing_doorframe_notch ===
On the nursery’s doorframe a child’s height has been recorded in notches as sharp as promises. Initials attend each line, marching up the wood with a pride that could have braved any fever. The last mark is higher than you would have expected for the dates given. A small nick below it looks like an error corrected with a knife. The wood accepts your touch with the courtesy of an old neighbor and keeps its numbers to itself.

=== node: basement_stairs_wet_step ===
Halfway down, one tread keeps its own weather. The wood is perpetually damp to the touch though the air offers no mist, no visible source. When your shoe tests it, the tread answers with a quiet grief that could be rot or could be memory. A dark crescent has formed where heel after heel avoided the center, a congregation of caution. On the stringer beside it, a plume of salt has feathered out from a nail—efflorescence, the polite name that looks nothing like its hard crystals. You can smell limestone and river in the damp, a rumor of the ground’s patience. Somewhere below, a drip counts in a tempo not yours. You notice you’ve begun holding your breath at each step as if lungs might make you heavier.

=== node: basement_stairs_rust_fleck ===
The railing under your palm leaves behind a constellation of rust no handkerchief will persuade to lift. The flecks glitter where the light from the open door cannot reach, like a private sky arranged by iron and sweat. At one post the paint has bubbled into a blister, and when you touch it the skin collapses, flaking away to expose metal bitten thin by a climate that never forgave. Your finger comes away stained and the stain looks exactly like dried blood until the air hits it and it browns further into something almost beautiful. There is a whiff of metal that makes the tongue a little dryer as if the body read danger faster than the mind.

=== node: basement_stairs_lime_dust ===
The heel of your hand collects a veil of white when you steady yourself against the wall. Lime dust. It nests in the pores of the brick and in the mortar like the memory of a storm, and when you draw a line through it your finger leaves a clean, decisive path that looks like an intention. The dust lifts in the smallest drafts and settles again as if the house were breathing out doctrine. You consider the purchases in the ledger—the quicklime—imagining what anyone would want to render sweet, to arrest. The dust clings to your cuffs with the affection of a pet you never owned and will not explain to anyone later.

=== node: basement_stairs_hollow_echo ===
When you tap the riser with your knuckle—an old carpenter’s habit that belongs to somebody else—the echo that returns is thin and hollow, not the good, dense talk of solid wood. The sound slips down and away like a coin dropped into a well and does not tell you where its bottom is. Pause. The house replies to itself in a delayed language: the faintest creak two treads above, a sigh from the wall as if a giant leaned. If you stop, if you give the echo time, it comes back altered, threaded with something that is not your timbre. It is easy to imagine an answering tap from the other side of the wall if you insist on imagining at all—and easier, if you are honest, to suspect that something below has been waiting for this conversation.

=== node: boiler_radiator_line ===
A fat pipe climbs out of the boiler’s shoulder and disappears into the ceiling, a vein for hot authority. When you lay your hand near it—not on it; you remember your lessons—the air harbors a heat that is not from today. The paint has scaled in a reptile pattern, each flake lifting at the corner like a hundred eyelids. Where the pipe meets the elbow a circle of cloth tape has fossilized into a beige halo, infused with decades of repairs and their small ambitions. If you hold your ear closer than is wise, you can hear something moving, water or steam or a company of whispering, and once in that sound it is difficult to insist that the hiss is only physics.

=== node: boiler_steam_whistle ===
The pressure relief sings in its sleep—a high, annoyed thread that you do not at first hear with ears but with teeth. It climbs half a tone and falls, repeats, bargaining with a number on a dial that regards you with an unblinking eye of brass. A careful hand has etched a notch into the case and a date near it, little graffiti of maintenance: gods appeased by offerings of attention. Somewhere in the lines above, a bead of condensation gathers its nerve, elongates with the grace of a dancer, and falls onto the housing with a click so bright it startles the shoulder, small percussion in a room that has hosted larger drums.

=== node: boiler_floor_slick ===
The concrete here knows all the stories. Dark and glossy, it slopes toward a drain that does its duty except when the house wishes to keep what it’s been given. A scumble of oil skeins the water into maps under your boot, and sawdust has been thrown in handfuls that found their own logic after they landed. Your weight transfers—too fast, the foot learning late—and the floor murmurs in a bad dialect that ends sentences with teeth. You manage the slip, but the body registers the rehearsal of falling with a change in breath you cannot hide from yourself. Knees remember stone.

=== node: boiler_pressure_relief ===
The relief valve has a little lever no one can resist and you are no one. You touch it a fraction and the machine answers—first with a tentative dribble, then a breath like an animal testing a new room’s odor. The heat that issues is clean in a way that reminds you of winter laundry, which is ridiculous here. The gauge’s needle quivers in a silent laugh and then steadies, the lesson delivered. The lever leaves a smell of metal and a stripe of grime on your thumb that insists you touched something more than a mechanism, some border between safe and not that every house hides.

=== node: ritual_circle_chalk ===
The circle has been drawn and wiped and drawn again, a palimpsest of decisions ground into stone. Chalk clings in a smear to the floor where the curve wavered, and between arcs you can see the ghost of an older circle larger by a handspan as if ambition flinched at the last and retreated. Symbols sit along the circumference like teeth in a jaw. Some are familiar—letters turned to face themselves, astrological shorthand—but others are stubborn, local to this room. When you kneel, your trouser knee prints a crescent of white that will travel with you like a herald until you forget and somebody asks.

=== node: ritual_heart_pulse ===
There is a point in the room where the air thickens and beats. At first you think it is your own pulse made audible by the act of listening, but when you step to the side it grows louder; when you step back, it recedes—not yours, then. It seems to come from under the stones, from the old earth’s quilt where roots knit themselves into knots, and the rhythm is wrong in a way that makes the ribs want to widen. You hold your breath and the beat continues, indifferent to your experiment. The candle in your hand flickers in sympathy and then steadies with a small, stubborn courage that is the only sane thing here.

=== node: ritual_candle_sputter ===
You cup the Black Candle and it answers with a guttering that reads like speech. Little tongues of flame lick at an invisible wind that should not exist underground. Wax runs down the rib like a tear and then hardens, caught in the act of weeping. The smell is bees and something medicinal, like a pharmacy a hundred years ago. When the sputter settles, the flame burns so clean it seems to pull darkness into itself rather than offer light. The wick glows with a heart of red and you remember, unbidden, a parlor match hissing to life and painting a lampshade with a planet.

=== node: ritual_whisper_return ===
Speak in this room and the room speaks back in the accent of your fear. Words fall from your mouth and return thinner, as if they had to travel through something hungry. When you do not speak, something else does: a sussuration like silk across a floor somewhere far below and far above at once. If you try the oldest trick—asking a name—you learn only yours, repeated, or what sounds like it, with one letter wrong. The wrongness is a trick of air or of a thing testing consonants it did not grow up with. The circle waits for order. Your tongue tastes chalk.

=== node: library_step_stool_scuff ===
The little step stool that serves the higher shelves is scarred where shoes met wood again and again, each scuff a prayer the books demanded from anyone who dared them. The top tread bears a crescent worn by a single footfall habitually placed; whoever used it was either always in a hurry or always returning, and the wood remembered this with a groove polished by leather and hope. When you slide the stool, it speaks to the floor in a syllable of complaint, and dust blooms from under the stacks as if the library exhaled slowly. The scrape reveals a hair-thin line scratched across the parquet, a compass mark pointing not north but toward the shelf where the history of saints resides, as though holiness were a direction measured in footsteps.

=== node: library_marginalia ===
The book you ease free turns out to have been read by someone who would not let it pass without argument. In the margins a fine, disciplined hand has fenced the typeset with ink: tiny counter-claims, sums correcting the author’s arithmetic, questions that taper into exclamation—each note signed with an initial that could be an L or an S depending on the light. In one chapter a passage is bracketed with twin vertical lines and the word “No” so forcefully written it almost tears the page. At the bottom of that same leaf, where the fore-edge gathers the dust of years, someone else has added a single dot of red ink as if to acknowledge the first reader without endorsing them. You read the contested sentence and feel a tug toward the basement as though debate itself were a weight.

=== node: library_bookplate ===
On the paste-down of a heavy volume a bookplate declares possession with a heraldic ambition out of scale to the room. The arms are quartered: a river, a palm, a star, and a thing that could be a heart or a knot of roots depending on how honest the light is. Beneath, a motto in Latin gives itself too easily to translation if you are willing to lie about a few verbs. The glue has shrunk, lifting one corner enough that you can work a fingernail under it. There, in the demilune of shadow, a penciled figure has slept for years: a date that doesn’t square with the printed edition, or a set of coordinates that do not exist on any map you own. When you press the plate back down, it holds with the obedience of a secret agreeing to remain such for one more day.

=== node: library_dust_lattice ===
Sun through the leaded glass draws a tight grid on the shelves, a scaffolding in light that the room seems to have been built to honor. The dust respects it, arranging in lanes and squares like a city you once loved. When you breathe, the motes drift and catch, knitting momentarily into a web that appears to vibrate, as if plucked by a distant fingertip. Across the lattice a book is missing, and the negative space where it ought to sit seems darker than a mere absence would suggest. You pass your hand through the light and your fingers acquire a down of knowledge—grit soft as flour, winter against your knuckles in a room that insists on summer.

=== node: library_chain_binding ===
One shelf holds volumes that were once chained for the public good, though only a few rusted staples remain to remember the tether. The leather spines have sprouted a rash of red where iron met tannin over seasons of humidity, the disease of devotion. You imagine a scholar standing here with a book drawn just far enough to read, the chain describing an arc of permission on the floorboards. At the end of the row a nail hole shows where the last link once anchored; someone pried it out with a chisel that slipped, leaving a crescent bite in the wood and a story nobody told enough.

=== node: library_call_number_misfile ===
There is a misfiled book halfway along the alphabet, a stranger wearing a neighbor’s coat. Its call number’s second line betrays it by a single digit that would embarrass a clerk more than a thief. You restore it to its rightful place and find that the gap it leaves is too narrow for your fingers but just wide enough to reveal, at the back of the shelf, a small pencil mark: a chevron and a circle, like a shorthand for “turn here.” When you nudge the adjacent volume, the shelf itself gives a sigh it has no right to, and a click answers from inside the wall with the satisfaction of a latch remembering its name. You stop before the seam opens and consider how much a secret wants to be found.

=== node: bedroom_a_nightstand ===
The nightstand’s drawer opens with the intimacy of an apology. Inside, a scatter of trivial loyalties: a button the color of tea, three hairpins that have taken on the geometry of the drawer, a small tin of pastilles that still carries a ghost of anise. Beneath these a scrap of ribbon has been folded around a lock of hair—lighter than you expected—and tied once, the knot collapsed like a lung that remembers breathing. The wood smells faintly of lavender and of something medicinal like camphor. In the felted groove rests a key that unlocks nothing you have yet seen, crude and homemade, its bit filed by a hand not entirely patient. When you close the drawer, it completes its journey with a hush as though agreeing not to mention any of this to the room.

=== node: bedroom_a_photo_under_glass ===
On the dresser a photograph has been trapped under a pane of glass cut to fit the wood’s slight warp. The picture shows the house from the garden, sharp as a confession; in the upstairs window a figure appears if you decide that it does. The silvering has fled the corners, leaving an aurora that makes the sky a chemistry of its own. There is a thumbprint on the glass, a perfect oval of grease that belongs to someone with finer hands than yours; when you align your print with it, the match is not quite. Beneath the frame, between cloth and oak, is a thin seam of dust that has arranged itself into a line as straight as a resolution. The light shifts and the figure in the window ceases to pretend it is not looking back.

=== node: bedroom_a_lace_curtain ===
The lace at the window has stories stitched into it: baskets and garlands, doves that look like fish if you squint, a pattern repeated into truth by patience and idle hours. A few threads have broken and been knotted back into the pattern, clever and almost invisible; the mends announce themselves only when the wind tries the curtain and the knots hold where the machine would have yielded. A moth has found a home in the hem and left behind a powder that glows when the sun strikes it, the moth’s idea of immortality. When you draw the curtain aside, the light redraws the room in negatives—dark where previously there was safety—and in that inversion, something on the floor near the bed reveals itself as a scuff unlike any other.

=== node: bedroom_b_washstand_crack ===
The porcelain basin bears a crack that a careful owner disguised with milk and patience; it runs like a river that changes its mind halfway to the sea. The line is dark at one end where a grain of rust has lodged, bright at the other where it pretends to be nothing at all. The pitcher beside it is light in the hand, untrue to its weight, a trick of the glaze or of thirst. A cake of soap rests in a dish stamped with a hotel’s name, as if the guest intended to return, and has not. The shadow the basin throws is oval and deep, a small eclipse that feels cooler than it should on your fingers.

=== node: bedroom_b_lavender_sachet ===
In the wardrobe, among linens that remember a press, a sachet sewn from a scrap of cotton and tied with a ribbon the color of a good bruise has kept its promise. When you squeeze it, the scent leaps in a dry, particular way—lavender that has lost its sweetness and become doctrine. It clings to the throat with a lesson about order, makes you think of lists and the comfort they offer before disasters. Hidden at the corners of the wardrobe are shallow scratches as if a mouse learned its alphabet here and stopped at A and L. You put the sachet back where it can continue its small work of arguing against time.

=== node: bedroom_b_floorboard_map ===
Beside the bed a board has learned to speak. When you step there, it confesses with a chirp the shape of a coastline, a sound that can become a contour in the mind if you step and step again. You kneel and the board shows you a nail whose head has thrummed up a fraction, inviting a pry that would be undignified but delicious. Through the seam you glimpse dust that is not the room’s dust, and a curl of paper that looks like an ear listening. If you slide a blade there, the board will lift; you do not, this time. Instead you sketch the pattern with your finger on your knee and think how even wood will draw a map to company if left alone long enough.

=== node: parlor_carpet_fringe ===
The rug’s border has a grammar of its own: a Greek key that walks the room’s perimeter like the mind pacing while the body sits. At one corner the fringe has been fingered into little ropes and then untwisted again, a worry bead’s work hidden beneath civility. When you kneel, a draft explores your ear like a confidante and you realize the rug floats on a skin of dust as fine as flour. One thread is darker, drawn through the fringe as if by a needle and then snapped short—an improvised repair that wanted to be invisible and failed. When you tug very gently, the thread resists as though anchored to something that does not live entirely in the plane of the floor.

=== node: parlor_curtain_fray ===
The parlor curtains are lighter than those in the dining room, a floral brocade that pretends it has not faded, presenting the same cheerful bouquet no matter the year. Along the lower hem a fray has been combed into little flags by air that must sometimes move when windows stand ostensibly closed. You pinch one and it disintegrates into fibers that float in the sun like plankton in an aquarium. A smell rises—old soap and sun-warmed fabric—and a memory arrives of your mother shaking out summer linens. There is a small smear at the hem as if someone brushed a hand here after handling graphite or ash. The pattern repeats on the other panel with an accuracy that feels like ritual rather than accident.

=== node: parlor_matchbook ===
Tucked into the corner of the mantel mirror is a matchbook advertising a hotel on Canal Street, its cover worn glossy by hands and pockets. Only three matches remain, their heads dull, salt-flecked with age. On the inside cover someone has penciled a number and a word you cannot quite make—Lazar? Lazare?—then erased it savagely, leaving a cloud the rubber could not lift. You strike one match out of manners and it stutters to life with a small, eager hiss that seems larger than it should in the parlor’s soft air. The sulfur bloom chases the violet perfume and for a second the room is a new place, a dangerous one. When the flame dies it leaves a thread of blue smoke that climbs to the ceiling and writes something there in script you cannot read.

=== node: parlor_window_latch ===
The sash latch is a small brass mouth with a missing tooth. It turns without convincing anything to seal, more theater than function. You test the window and it lifts a fraction, enough to let the garden’s breath in and to send a tremor through the curtains that is not quite wind. Outside the glass a fly walks its map of the world, rubbing its hands with the meticulousness of a jeweler. Inside, the sill is scarred with half-moons where a previous latch bit harder; between them, a smear of color like the memory of blood dried thin. Through the gap comes, not a sound, but the feeling of sound—the expectant hush a room makes when someone is about to speak and chooses not to.

=== node: parlor_lampshade_smoke ===
The lampshade nearest the piano bears a soot ring where heat once licked the paper a little too often. If you slide your finger along it, the black comes away with the compliance of old scandals. Beneath, the silk has browned into a halo, a fossil of light. When you switch the lamp on, the bulb glows obediently and the ring becomes a planet, present in negative, orbiting the room’s center of gravity. Dust motes arrange themselves around it in currents that mimic breath. On the lamp’s base, a faint outline persists where a small picture frame once stood—lighter metal surrounded by darkness—as if someone removed a person from the room by removing their image.

=== node: parlor_fireplace_tile ===
Each tile before the hearth is hand-painted with a pastoral scene that grows stranger the longer you allow it. What you first took as a shepherd is, on second inspection, a figure wearing a coat too long for its arms; the sheep have eyes like commas. One tile is crazed with a web of fine cracks that form a map of a coastline you almost recognize from the property survey. A chip exposes the red clay beneath like muscle showing through skin. You press your palm to the tile and it holds cold in a way that feels purposeful—as if the tile stores winter to spend on anyone who dares the fire. Under the grate, something small has been tucked: a bent hairpin and a copper coin, together like a spell to keep the ash obedient.

=== node: conservatory_plant_labels ===
Each pot wears a small zinc label written in a hand that considered its plants by their Latin names as if that might keep them from dying. Condensation has filmed the surfaces so the ink looks underwater, letters densest at their stems and ghosting outward like ink bleeding under skin. The labels themselves are cold even in the warm air, and when you rub one dry the ink lifts, staining your thumb with a classification that now belongs to you. A handful have been turned backward, their names facing the soil as if to protect the plants from themselves. One label is blank, and that is the pot with something still alive in it.

=== node: conservatory_potting_table ===
The slatted table bears the scars of planting: knife cuts, soil welded into plank seams, a trough for a brush that now holds only a silt of green. A line of terracotta pots sits inverted like a quiet choir. Beneath one is a strike of white powder, lime or ash, drawn into a crescent as though someone brought the pot down onto a circle and rotated it, testing a seal. A length of twine has been looped around a nail and then around itself, the knot a neat sailor’s habit in a landlocked room. When you press your palm into the table, the wood prints your skin with a pattern that takes a moment to fade and in that moment feels like writing.

=== node: conservatory_terracotta_shards ===
On the floor, a fan of broken terracotta radiates from an absence where a pot must have fallen and not been swept. The shards are the color of dried brick and when you fit two together they click like teeth. A few edges wear a dark green slick, as if a plant’s last language was to paint its vessel during collapse. Between the pieces, a seed rests like a comma waiting for a clause that never came. When you step away, your shoe carries a crescent of dust that resembles a fingerprint too large to belong to anyone in the house.

=== node: conservatory_rain_pattern ===
The conservatory’s roof registers weather like a diary. Streaks and arcs and blossoms of mineral scale form constellations that repeat after each storm but never identically. You tilt your head and see a pattern that might be the river mapped in chalk; you tilt again and it becomes the branching of lungs. A drop forms far above and hesitates at the lip of a join that failed a season ago, then falls exactly where your shoulder will be if you do not step away. When it strikes, the sound is sharper than the size of the water would justify—too articulate for a mere drip, as if the drop contained words under pressure.

=== node: conservatory_watering_can ===
The watering can is tin, dented into a new capacity by someone who learned their lessons by bumping against the world. Its spout holds the last of yesterday in a chain of beads that do not fall until you exhale on them. The handle has grooved the palm’s shape into itself. When you tip the can over your hand, the smell of metal and algae and the faintest memory of lilies rises. Water catches light in the mesh of the rose and scatters it onto your sleeve in coins you cannot spend. When you set it down, it answers the tile with a ring that lasts too long, like a bell’s twin in another room.

=== node: conservatory_floor_drain ===
In the center of the tile is a brass drain whose pattern is a flower or a wheel depending on the hour. A few roots, hair-thin and white, have found their way to the grate from below, seeking daylight with all the optimism of an idea. The air near the drain is cooler in a way your ankles notice. You crouch and think you hear, beneath the regular house sounds, a distant running—water or something that imitates water to pass as harmless. The grate shifts under your finger with a reluctance that suggests it has been lifted before by someone in a hurry. The smell that rises when you pry it the width of a coin is not of rot but of earth shocked by a door opened underground.

=== node: dining_table_marks ===
The tabletop yields its history to the light at a slant. Long shallow scars cross like tides on a sandbar where years of knives kissed the wood aside from the plates. There are darker ellipses where decanters lingered, ghost rings of spirits that evaporated but left their halos. Near the head of the table, faint nested crescents mark where someone tapped a signet against the wood again and again while thinking—the geometry of impatience. You run your fingers along the edges and feel minute burrs, chips that catch the skin like a whisper asking you to stay. In the trimmed silence of the room, the table’s surface reads like a palimpsest of appetite and argument, of laughter that lifted, of a slammed hand that ended it. The marks align under your hand as if guiding it toward the letter at the head, as though the scratches themselves were a trail of breadcrumbs leading you back to the one choice that matters: to open what has already been opened, or to pretend the seal still holds.

=== node: dining_servant_bell ===
The small brass bell is mounted discreetly beneath the table’s lip, exactly where a host’s hand might fall between courses. Its pull is a frayed silk cord the color of old champagne. You give it the gentlest tug and somewhere, deep in the house’s bones, a wire sings like a struck nerve. The sound does not carry; it travels. It threads through wainscot and riser, through joist and pipe, humming to itself until it finds silence to join. You imagine it waking in the pantry, where a call like this once meant soup removed, roast presented, wine surveyed. No feet answer. Still, a draft whispers from the corridor as if something changed its mind about staying asleep. The bell continues to vibrate against your knuckle a fraction longer than it should, as though the house were echoing the gesture back to your skin.

=== node: dining_window_sash ===
The velvet drapes give reluctantly, their pile remembering centuries of hands. Behind them, the tall window is separated into a grid of panes that ripple the garden into a dream of itself. The sash is painted and repainted into stubbornness, but a fingernail of movement remains if you lift from one corner and push from the other. A fine rain of dried paint flakes drops onto the sill like dandruff, chalking your sleeves. You lean closer and see in the glass a thin smear, the print of a finger that dragged across it, hesitated, then continued. On the outside ledge, a dead moth has been arranged beside a sliver of bone so small it could be a fish’s rib. When the light changes, a shape moves across the panes that cannot be the garden—it moves as if within the glass, a swim of darkness like a fish in an aquarium that has forgotten the water.

=== node: dining_fireplace_ash ===
The hearth is more shrine than furnace. Ash has been brushed to the sides in deliberate scallops, exposing a floor of brick the color of scabbed cherries. You kneel and touch the ash; it is finer than baking flour and colder than one would expect from dust so long sheltered. Someone drew a circle here, then wiped it away and drew it again, because you can see a ghost circle offset a fraction, as if the hand were unsure of which diameter would fit. A burnt thread remains in the grate, black soot on the pad of your thumb. It smells faintly of tallow and something medicinal, like a pharmacist’s back room. Under one brick a looseness suggests storage; when you press, it shifts but does not give. The sense of rehearsal clings to your cuffs: this was a place where someone practiced a ritual without the courage to complete it.

=== node: dining_linen_stain ===
The tablecloth is white at a distance and every color when your eye surrenders. Here a bloom of wine leans into the fabric like a galaxy, edges browned by time into the color of a healer’s tincture. There a track of candle grease hardened into droplets like a comet’s tail. Close to your wrist a pair of small, perfectly round spots sit side by side, a colon in a sentence you cannot read. You think of fingers held beneath the table, of a nosebleed staunched into linen, of a key hidden and then forgotten when the conversation turned. When you lift the cloth’s hem, the underside has its own map of stains reversed as constellations. A faint perfume rises—violets again—but this time there is a low note beneath it, something like iron left in rain.

=== node: dining_loose_panel ===
At the far wall a wainscot panel does not sit flush. You discover it only because your shoulder brushes it and the wood answers with a different note, a hollowed vowel instead of a consonant. The seam is narrow but it widens if you press in one place and pull in another. Behind, a shallow cavity breathes cool dust and a hint of soap. There is a folded scrap of newsprint that names a storm year you remember your father describing, and a small bundle of hair tied with ribbon, the bow crisp as a dead insect. Something else has been removed; the dust has an outline of absence the size of a missive. When you replace the panel, it hangs a fraction more true, as if grateful for the attention. The smell of dust lingers on your fingers as if you had shaken an old hand.

=== node: study_ink_blot ===
Under the desk blotter, the corner of a sheet has glued itself to the leather with an ink spill that dried to satin. You ease it free. The blot is not random; the center is dense as a night without stars, but the edges feather into wings and antlers, a bestiary of nearly-things that your mind wants to complete. Someone tested the nib here and then paused, letting a sentence clot before it could be born. You tip the paper and oil makes rainbows in the black, a sheen that is not color so much as memory of color. When you touch the center, the stain stays on your finger, refusing to dry even now, as if it were a pool connected to some deeper reservoir where language goes when it refuses to be obedient.

=== node: study_pen_nib ===
The fountain pen is heavier than it looks, chased with vines that curl in a script of their own. Its nib is gold but the split is splayed a hair, like lips parted to breathe. You examine the feed and find a clot of ink that never met paper, a sentence resting forever just behind the teeth. When you hold the nib to the light, tiny burrs catch like hooks; this is a pen for declarations and resignations, not for lists. The cap’s inner threads carry a smell that is almost almond, almost poison. You cap and uncap it and hear, beneath the small mechanical click, a second sound as if something were swallowing.

=== node: study_paper_smell ===
Pulling open the bottom drawer releases a smell that is the library’s ancestor: lignin turned sweet by heat, glue that has dreamed of horses too long, dust from years when coal was a currency. It is a smell your bones know from schoolrooms and ledgers and the inside of a hat box your grandmother kept letters in. The papers here are not ledgers; they are letters and drafts, the fragments of a life that took itself seriously. One ragged edge shows where a page was torn out with a haste that apologized to no one. At the very back a sheet bears an imprint from heavy hands—words written on the missing page impressed a ghost paragraph here: a negative of intent. You can almost read it by slanting light and patience, the way a detective reads what someone tried too late to hide.

=== node: study_seal_press ===
On the credenza sits a small seal press, iron smoothed by a century of anxious thumbs. The die is cut with a device you do not recognize: a stag or a palmetto palm or both depending on how your eye lands. You lever the arm and it descends with solemn little authority, pressing invisible wax onto invisible envelopes. There is, in the tray beneath, a crumb of red sealing wax as brittle as sugar glass. When you pinch it, it collapses into dust that stains your skin with a ceremonial blush. You imagine the bell in the dining room pulling, the envelope lifted from the tray, the press coming down like a sentence—formal, final, and in the end mutable to anyone willing to steam.

=== node: study_ledger ===
The ledger is a cousin of the house itself: respectable, heavy, hiding its most interesting rooms behind ordinary doors. Marbled boards. A spine repaired with a strip of canvas that once was blue. Inside, columns of figures march for years, steady and unsurprised, until near the end the handwriting loosens. Purchases appear that are not like the others—candles not in the usual lots, a shipment of lime, a payment to a mason whose name repeats off and on like the pulse of a bad dream. There is a page with a line ruled through it so emphatic that the pen tore the paper. The bleed-through on the verso looks like lightning in miniature. In the gutter, an edge is darker where something rested long enough to drink the ledger’s breath: a letter? a key? a blade?

=== node: study_map_tube ===
In the umbrella stand a leather cylinder pretends to be an umbrella. The cap is tight. When it releases, it exhales desiccated glue. Inside: a rolled map, linen-backed, of the property and its neighboring plots as surveyed in a year when the river made a liar of the boundary stones. The house is drawn in delicate hatching; beneath, faint pencil additions suggest rooms that never were or passages the surveyor did not feel compelled to share with the official copy. Along one margin, in a different hand, someone has inscribed a series of numbers that could be dates or elevations or a code that means both. The map resists refurling, as if it would prefer to remain an argument spread across the desk forever.

It would be so easy to turn back. The double gate behind you is still ajar, a slender margin of safety. Yet the key from the solicitor is heavy in your pocket, and the ledger that needs a signature has its own gravity. You advance, noticing small betrayals of neglect: a cracked paving stone now serving as ant thoroughfare; a toppled pot sinking into the earth, its fern thriving as if nourished by the fall. The door is close enough now for the brass knocker to show a lion’s face, its mane stylized into little tongues of flame.

=== node: foyer ===
The double doors complain on their hinges and then accept you, and the house inhales. Cool air, stale with polish and the recirculations of time, folds around your shoulders. A chandelier the color of old ice hangs above the checkerboard floor, its crystals filmed with dust so that each teardrop blurs into the next. The grand staircase climbs in an elegant curve like the back of a great animal turning away; its balusters are knuckled at the top where generations of hands made small, identical decisions. To the right an arch opens into a parlor where a pianoforte keeps its own counsel. To the left a dining room glows faintly with the gloss of wood under shrouds. Straight back, a corridor darkens toward the kitchen and pantry. The quiet is not complete. It is an old house quiet, stitched with tiny, meaningful seams: the soft creek of a beam adjusting to the barometer, a faint tick somewhere like a mouse studying the clock.

You inhale again and taste lemons, old wine, and the waxy echo of bees who built the candles that once threw light upon arriving guests. On a console table near the door lies a silvered tray, its mirror blackened. A number of calling cards bloom out of a dish like stark white petals, names printed in inks the color of dried blood, of faded roses, of shadows. A correspondence stand holds envelopes still addressed in a hand more disciplined than yours. When you close the doors behind you, the muffled click sounds final in a way the street never did, as if a chapter has been quietly seated in its place on a shelf.

=== node: dining_room ===
The dining room is a theater between performances. The long mahogany table stretches beneath a mirror whose mercury has soured into islands and archipelagos. At each place a plate waits under a film of dust, and some are still paired with knives and forks that show the faintest trace of their last polish in crescent moons near the handles. A cluster of decanters leans together on a sideboard like conspirators sharing the last joke of a party that long ago dissolved into rain. The drapes—the heavy velvet kind that turn noon into evening—are drawn, but a thin seam of daylight insists at their edges like the ghost of a stage–hand peering through. The smell is lemon oil and stale port and something like violets. There is a letter, folded once, at the head of the table. The paper is brittle, the crease white as a bone. The seal has been broken and carefully pressed shut again with the damp of a fingertip.

You lift it. The handwriting is elegant and firm, the kind that drills across the page without hesitation. It speaks of errands and of the boiler that will not hold its temper, of noises under the pantry floor that are surely rats, and of dreams the writer would not insult you by recording in ink. There is a name—no surname—under a final line that might have been a prayer or a spell depending on the reader’s appetite for miracles. The letter leaves faint smudges on your fingers, as if its ink remembered the hand that wrote it too well to fully let go. You set it down exactly as you found it, and yet it does not seem to lie in precisely the same place.

=== node: study ===
The study’s walls are books: calfskin and buckram, cloth and leather, spines cracked where wisdom or vanity forced the binding more times than it should. Dust here gathers not indiscriminately but in little eddies where the owner once reached often, and abandons other shelves altogether for a generation at a time. A broad desk occupies the room’s sober heart. On its felt lies an inkwell whose black lake dried to a shallow obsidian mirror, and a fountain pen that remembers a script tidy enough to shame you. The top drawer resists politely; you palm the handle and it offers a breath, then yields with a sound like paper gently sighing. Inside: envelopes in a neat stack, a seal stamp colder than it should be, and a small brass key that has no obvious function.

A cabinet against the far wall carries an aspect of ceremony. Behind its glass a hook presents a dull iron key whose surface seems to have collected the breath of windows left open on damp nights. When you lift it, the metal takes your warmth without gratitude. The key is simple as tools should be, neither decorative nor meek, and if a key could look you in the eye this one would prefer to watch your hands instead. On a side table a globe leans into the world as it was when mapmakers assumed oceans could be negotiated with a good hat and a better sentence. Somewhere behind the wainscoting, a vertical seam feels not like poor carpentry but like a door’s idea of pretending.

=== node: kitchen ===
The kitchen sits with its own weather. A great iron range dominates, belly silent, doors like lids on the kinds of pots you wish your life required. Copper pans hang dull and perfect along a rail, each with a different history of heat printed on its skin: rings and shadows like eclipses. The flagstones are chilled even through your soles. A scent holds close to the ceiling: iron, vinegar, onions gone old, and something sweet whose name you cannot immediately place. The sink’s porcelain is nicked and crazed with hairline fractures that map a country no one ever intended to visit twice. A pantry door holds a tilt you wouldn’t notice if not for the way the neighboring cabinet has squared itself up in opposition.

There is a rug before the pantry, the sort meant for wiping one’s moral slate before stepping in. It lies almost exactly so. The corner nearest the icebox turns up just enough to admit a fingernail; the frayed edge shows threads that would be glad to be done with the ragged business of being a rug at all. When you stand very still you think you can hear water moving, not loudly, not even from any particular direction, but as if the house had a vein of something colder running through its bones. A fly makes its pointless figure–eights nearer and nearer and then decides against your existence.

=== node: pantry ===
Shelves crowd both sides, boards bowed under the weight of jars whose labels have given themselves over to blur. You read with your nose instead: cloves dried to bark; peaches embalmed into an amber dream of August; onions sending a root into the dark as a test. Flour dust coats a forgotten measuring cup with the precise snow of a crime scene. The rug has followed you like an accomplice, and when you toe it aside with the humility of someone interfering in an old arrangement, it obliges with less resistance than you deserve. There, a circle of iron grins from the floor—the kind of finger ring sailors call friend, the kind that understands leverage better than anyone.

The hatch answers your pull with a cough of colder air, damp and honest. The smell is brick and old stone and that faint—almost human—note of the earth exhaling after a long day. Steps descend into a black that is not strictly hostile, only very sure of itself. The sound that reached your ear in the kitchen is clearer now: drip, wait, drip. You feel an impulse to count them, as if any improper tally might insult the symmetry of what lies below. The flashlight in your bag throws a begrudging cone. Something in the beam, some small insect or mote, crosses and is gone.

=== node: cellar_entrance ===
The staircase is narrow enough to feel like a confidence and steep enough to make that intimacy your concern. The mortar joins between the bricks have sanded themselves into little valleys by time alone. As your foot finds each step, moisture murmurs beneath the leather, and the wall keeps your shoulder like a colleague who knows more than she will say. The sound of the house above becomes at once very distant and oppressive, as if its weight is gathering on a point just beyond your reach.

Your light chalks the outlines of a landing, then more stairs, then a dark that acquires the notion of rooms. Air moves, not hurriedly, as if called and only agreeing to come because one must honor old covenants. You taste metal and damp lime on the back of your tongue. If you were to call out a name you are not certain the voice would be yours when it returned.

=== node: parlor ===
The parlor waits with the patience of furniture. Wallpaper in a floral pattern has peeled at the seams, curling into the gesture of a smile not meant for company. The pianoforte—hers?—is shut, the key cover a lid over teeth that know every hymn and some songs not invited. On the mantle a clock tick–ticks without hands, its heartbeat uninvested in the telling of time. A portrait of a woman studies the room rather than the visitor; her eyes are the wrong color or the right color—one of those problems that improves or worsens depending on whether you decide it matters.

An armchair near the window has perfected the art of implied company. If you were to sit, it would receive you as an understudy receives the role: fully prepared, a little hungry. The curtains have learned to move even without a breeze because the house prefers sincerity over physics. There is, in a saucer under a little glass dome, a poignant and successful cake of soap. It smells of violets and economy. You imagine conversations snapped short at the moment before truth would have made them worthwhile.

=== node: conservatory ===
The conservatory is a greenhouse set to the elegy key. Glass panes wear the milk of weather and the faint geometry of evaporated storms. In that softened daylight, the green achieves the kind of hush a chapel fumbles toward. A wrought bench grows patient near a palm that has learned humility in a pot too small for its religion. Ferns frill the edges of cracked tile; a creeping fig tests the seam where a pane meets the frame and finds that patience makes locksmiths of us all.

Underfoot the floor buckles in a long, thoughtful wave, a geology lecture speaking from the roots of the garden. Fat drops hang on the glass and fall at intervals you come to anticipate, like the last audience clapping out the chorus. Somewhere a bee that came in with last year’s flowers made a decision, died, and was carried into the corners by the quiet geometry of tidying. In the corner, a watering can has rusted through in a perfect oval. Whoever loved this room intended a world and achieved a tender version of it that still remembers the hand.

=== node: grand_staircase ===
The staircase climbs with a grace earned rather than inherited. The banister is satin where palms have petitioned it for generations; in the shallows of each curve you can almost count the arguments that took place as feet climbed and voices followed. Each tread releases a particular note so that in ascent or descent you are playing a chord whose name you suspect the house invented. Light pools and shallows along the runner in the patterns old houses make when they have decided you are important but not central to the afternoon.

Halfway up, the foyer shrinks into the kind of narrative framed in mirrors. Up top, the landing opens like a solved problem, doors arranged with that overconfident New World optimism that rooms stay where they are put.

=== node: landing ===
The landing delivers you to a hallway with a natural boulevard’s pride. Bedroom doors to left and right wear their brass like medals, not flashy but sincere. Ahead, the nursery door is painted in paler colors, as if to remind everyone who knocks to be gentle or leave. The library presents itself with a seriousness that nudges your shoulders square, while the master suite clings to discretion the way old money clings to linen. A door at the end of the hall negotiates with the outside world via a balcony that cannot decide if it is escape or invitation.

The carpet here consumes sound greedily, and the walls return your breath with the softest refusal to echo. A draft runs the corridor like a whispered rumor that prefers to pass behind your ear. Under the skirting boards you can hear, if you choose to make much of small reports, the house’s smaller bones speaking to one another in ticks and air–swallows.

=== node: bedroom_a ===
The room is a museum of domestic ambition. Wallpaper riots with flowers that time has obliged by fading into sepia, accidentally perfect as a forgotten photograph. The bed is made with a precision that suggests love or an ambition to be loved, sheets tight under a coverlet whose crocheted lattice confuses your eye into believing it holds secrets. The closet door is slightly ajar as if embarrassed by having tried too hard to close. In the nightstand a Bible opens of its own accord to a psalm about valleys of shadow, the onion–skin page more opaque where the verses have been traced again and again in the mind if not the margin.

On the windowsill a crack in the paint betrays the shape of something once hung and then annihilated with more energy than good sense. If you breathe on the glass and write your name, the mist leaves your letters a moment longer than seems necessary, as if the room were willing to try out the spell and then, politely, to return you to your own custody.

=== node: bedroom_b ===
Neatness defines itself here in mild tyrannies. The bed-linens are uncreased, the pillows demure, the washstand’s pitcher empty but not guilty about it. The wardrobe door has been left as a gesture rather than from forgetfulness; its hinge has a small, interrogative squeal when you nudge it wider, the kind of sound a good friend makes when you contradict yourself. The carpet shows no particular traffic patterns. On the mantle, the small porcelain dog looks toward a place that no longer exists in the room.

In the plaster beside the window a gouge begins and ends with the decisiveness of someone tearing down a future. It feels like the negative of a frame that once housed a certificate or a portrait or a map leading somewhere the rest of the house has promised not to compromise. You touch the groove and the dust clings not like dirt but like the kind of trust even ruins believe in.

=== node: nursery ===
Rocking horse, cradle, a small chair absolutely certain of its purpose. The air is colder by an honest margin, the sort of difference you would have missed if the rest of the house had not tutored you in subtleties. The wallpaper’s rabbits and moons trust you to be kind; if you look while thinking of other things, they wriggle out of their obligations and rearrange themselves into a new order you’re certain was always there, until you blink and the pattern returns to its well-bred cheer. A cupboard that could hold toys holds, in fact, a peculiar hush.

A laugh sounds from the wrong place: not beyond the wall but in its thickness, not ahead or behind but in a flavor of space you do not have a good word for. You swallow and it sounds loud. Your breath lifts a strand of hair that is not yours from the cradle’s coverlet. The mobile above the crib—three little tin balloons—twists once and decides to rest as if conceding a negotiation.

=== node: library ===
Shelves reach nearly to the ceiling and meet ladders that have rolled along their rails in little missions for as long as the luck of ankles has held out. Some bindings have the disciplined look of law and scripture, others the reckless exotica of travelers who wrote as if the world were a mirror they could correct with a pen. A glass case on a pedestal holds a black candle in tallow that swallows light rather than reflects it, and beside it a slim book whose leather runs a shade so dark it shames the color black into humility. When your fingers hover above the case, the air cools just enough to make superstition a form of politeness.

Along the wainscoting a seam marks a secret that is poor at the social performance of being secret. Behind a row, a shelf’s dust is smeared the way dust goes when it protests an intrusion but lacks the standing to veto it. A stool waits under a window where light chooses to become a lover of paper rather than of faces. You find yourself forming the sort of questions that do not accept the first answer given. The air has the particular hush of a listener who dislikes names; something attends here that would prefer you not to call it anything at all.

=== node: master_suite ===
The master suite has made treaties with light. Curtains of velvet fall like slow rain, and where they part, windows discipline the afternoon into slats you could stack as evidence in any argument about elegance. The bed’s carved headboard holds laurel and lilies that have overseen long peace and some negotiated truces. The dressing table’s mirror, faintly silvered at the edges, regards you not unkindly but with the sort of interest the ocean pays to a single shell. In the right–hand drawer, wrapped in linen with monograms so tidy they might have been etched, lies a silver dagger that has been recently and carefully cleaned. Its edge is an idea you can feel along your teeth without opening your mouth.

On the vanity a bottle of scent has evaporated into a ghost that refuses to leave. The rug underfoot is soft enough to offer the kind of forgiveness people beg of one another and rarely find. If there is a ledger of harm and grace in the house, this room would know where it is kept and who has the key. You pause, holding the dagger, and find the air waiting to see which story you prefer to tell.

=== node: balcony ===
The door to the balcony opens with the air of a secret cleared by committee. Outside, the world floats at a slightly different angle. The garden below arranges itself into geometry: the path becomes vertebrae; the fountain, a bone. The iron railing gives under your palm in a way that is not a threat but a reminder that metal has a memory of heat and cold you only ever borrow. The sky is thinking of thunder. It speaks to itself along the horizon, practicing the shape of its name.

A breeze arrives from directions the map does not reserve for wind. The lingering perfume of something white and nocturnal—the jasmine again, unseasonable and stern—finds you as if you had asked politely between mouthfuls of doubt. The rail has spots polished bright where hands have scanned it for permission. Some of those hands did not receive it.

=== node: basement_stairs ===
The basement stair’s banister holds a story a child invented to stay brave and then taught to generations. The wall beside it is damp in places where water has worn its patience into a series of coins pressed flat along the mortar. The air trades you a promise: follow, and be given something; turn, and keep what you have no words for anyway. Your light finds the edge of a landing, then another run down, then a space that does not want to be called a room.

At your back the house becomes theory: not weight, not lumber and lath, not the thousand decisions of carpenters, but a set of expectations your body would rather not rehearse in the dark. Ahead, the stair counts you the way a procession counts itself down to what the priest will never name out loud.

=== node: boiler_room ===
The boiler room’s floor has confessed to water and water has agreed to stay awhile. Puddles hold ceilings in their mirrors, broken by the slow punctuation of drips that compose an impatient essay about gravity. The hulking boiler squats with a dignity refused the living; pipes crowd the walls like veins taking the long way around. The metal’s black paint was not new when the war ended; it will not be new if another begins. A wrench lies on its side near a drain that drains only in theory, red rust tasting the air like it could decide to live on breath alone.

The floor tilts, not enough to alarm the part of you that knows floors, enough to quicken the lesser animal that keeps count in your ribs. Stains make maps. Scorches make annotations. In the corner a neat stack of coal has slumped as if embarrassed to be so tidy in a room where nothing else keeps its spine. When you listen long enough, you hear a sound like an exhale through teeth, and realize it is you.

=== node: catacombs_1 ===
Brick passages run like nerves. The mortar has accepted the roots’ petitions here and there, little curtains of hair creeping through with the modesty of thieves pleased with themselves. Your lantern draws a honeyed sheen from the damp, and in that warmth your breath makes a ghost that tries to stand and then accepts your lungs back with a shrug. In an alcove a scrap of muslin hangs from a nail, perfume clinging as if it believed humans were a season.

You chalk an arrow on a brick as if the brick were listening.

=== node: catacombs_2 ===
The corridor splits and turns without commitment. Alcoves suggest vessels long ago carried away to rooms where rites are efficient and conversation unnecessary. The air tastes like coins warmed in a hand. Your footfalls practice deception, sounding ahead and then behind as the tunnels privately measure you. Somewhere a trickle insists the earth is hollow. Somewhere else, the sound of settling brick pretends to be someone remembering their own name.

=== node: catacombs_3 ===
Three gouges run in parallel along a wall at the height of a shoulder. You set your palm there and it does not fit. The mark does not read as tool or animal; it reads as the criticism of something large and patient. A draft curls past with the intimacy of a whisper delivered by someone who means you neither harm nor rescue. The tunnel ahead kinks to the right as if embarrassed by its own intentions.

=== node: catacombs_4 ===
Driftwood made of furniture bones piles in a niche, chair–legs and bed–rails and splinters arranged as though by a tide whose moon is neglect. A garden spade leans nearby; the handle is smooth where hands have made an agreement with splinters. If you tap the blade with a knuckle, the sound returns wearing a distance you cannot verify with a ruler. Dust rises and catches your light in a slow confetti of undoing.

=== node: catacombs_5 ===
The ceiling drops and the floor widens into a chamber whose proportions make the animal in your sternum lift its head. The scraped circles on the stone read like instructions left by someone who believed in geometry’s capacity to keep promises. The air here is still enough that your own movement seems impolite. If a thing were to assemble itself from bone and intention, this would be a room in which it would do so, and it would be patient with you so long as you were patient with it.

=== node: ritual_chamber ===
The chamber understands ceremony. The stone basin at its center does not so much hold a heart as hold the idea of a heart, the notion of something that learned to beat here and then never forgot. Niches in the wall have been theatrical about their contents: a candle darker than shadow; a dagger whose edge lives outside the realm where edges and surfaces usefully distinguish themselves; a book that refuses to weigh less with the years. The walls sweat the way walls will when the earth around them remembers an ocean. Each drip marks a small countdown to something you cannot name without sounding greedy.

The light bends as if deciding to attend a different service. Your breath finds a slower rhythm not because you have asked it to but because the room insists on its liturgy. You stand at the threshold longer than you intend to and then not long enough. The air tastes of salt and old prayers; the circle at your feet has been drawn and erased until the floor remembers it better than any chalk could. You hear your own pulse answering a deeper, slower beat that is not in your blood.

When the Black Candle takes fire, the flame does not illuminate so much as claim. Shadows withdraw into taller versions of themselves and the temperature drops by a degree the body considers personal. When you open the Tome, the pages hesitate—as if you had asked a favor of a clerk who despises you—and then offer lines that seem to read you back. You speak the words because there is no world in which silence would save you now. The Presence arrives without footfall: a pressure on the eardrums, a widening between ribs, the sound a room makes when a conversation stops without agreement. It is not a shape. It is an insistence.

And then, the Dagger. You raise silver that is heavier than its length predicts and step into the argument you lit and read. The heart in the basin is not flesh; it is a metronome for an old anger. When the blade meets it, sound shatters like glass dropped into snow. The beat doubles, stutters, falters. The room leans hard to one side, as if the house tried to rise and tripped on a memory. Your shoulder meets stone; your palm finds the floor; your mouth tastes iron only because your teeth have struck each other.

What leaves the chamber when the beat ceases is not smoke, not wind, not light, and yet the absence it creates rings like a bell. You are alone with your breath, the small courageous flame of the candle, and the knowledge that something which prefers to remain unnamed just learned yours and decided not to keep it. The tunnel beyond is the size of a future and the house above waits to learn which one you choose.

=== node: end_successful ===
You step into a tunnel that opens where tunnels do not belong, reeds of roots brushing your shoulders like priests checking for contraband grace. The garden accepts you without commentary, though the jasmine does that sharp little thing again with its perfume as if overhearing gossip and wanting to expel it. Dawn, or something like it, balances on the house’s eaves and then climbs without asking your permission. Behind you the structure exhales. It is not relief and not surrender; it is the sound of a long calculation arriving at a term whose sign anyone might argue about.

You do not look back because the looking is a sermon you have heard. You carry the silence left in your pockets and the weight of having been told something true in a language you only partly understand. The road, when you reach it, remains the road, and that is both everything and exactly what the road promised to be.

=== node: end_dead ===
There is a small, precise moment when meaning leaves the room. It is neither an error nor a cruelty; it is an arithmetic that has practiced itself for so long it has no vanity left. Breath petitions for return and is refused by a bureaucracy that does not recognize the name on the form. A sound you will never hear again makes a polite bow—in your own throat, perhaps in someone else’s memory—and then the theater is struck. Here is a body; here is the idea that it was once a person; here is the kindness other bodies offer the idea, for as long as their arms remember how.

=== node: end_madness_1 ===
Counting develops moods. The rabbits on the nursery wallpaper teach you an arithmetic suited to their governance: numbers that run away when pursued and return when fed crumbs of sleep. The moon shows you faces you recognize from portraits you have never seen. You speak to the constable with a fluency no one recorded and he nods because nodding is the one human verb that shares a border with mercy. Your hands remember the cradle perfectly though nothing is ever inside it again.

=== node: end_madness_2 ===
The tunnels consent to be mapped only by devotion, and you are an apostle with bad shoes. You learn the names of bricks as one learns the secret middle names of friends: in confidence, with reverence, and without expecting permission to use them. When you sleep—and you do—you dream of circles that are perfectly round without ever closing. When people find you, you guide them to the exit with such tenderness they suspect you have drawn the map yourself in blood. You have not. The map is older than that.

=== node: end_scarred_1 ===
You lift yourself onto the balcony rail with deliberation a court might envy. The drop is not as far as it will feel and not as short as people say afterward. Mid–air, time tries to conduct an interview, but your bones answer and the rest remains on the cutting room floor. The ground does what ground does, which is remember every other body that has asked the same favor. Tomorrow arrives dressed as pain. Years from now you will smell wet iron before it rains.

=== node: end_scarred_2 ===
You run the way a confession runs—out of a mouth and into a quiet room where someone is patient. The tunnel is a thing that should not exist and yet has the manners of a host who has been expecting you. Roots stitch shadows into little capes and you wear them in sequence until the cold air of the garden wraps you in something like linen. You do not stop until the road forgives you with the indifference only roads achieve, and the first car of the morning regards you as just another person late for a vow.
=== node: dining_letter ===
You unfold the letter as if releasing a trapped breath, careful not to accelerate the paper’s small ruin. The hand is steady and unafraid of ink, each loop and stroke the work of someone who has written more than one truth and paid for the privilege. It mentions the boiler in a scolding tone and the pantry in a worried one, then swerves toward dreams with a formality that does not disguise alarm. Rats, yes—always rats until they are not—but something heavier than vermin shifts beneath the floor, pauses as if listening back, then rearranges its weight in a language made of joists and fatigue.

The last paragraph is a geometry of refusal. The writer will not record what the window reflected, will not describe the way the drapes moved without wind, will not dignify with nouns the murmured syllables under the nursery door at noon. The name at the end is familiar without being friendly, a first name you have seen on invoices and the occasional card at the greengrocer, never attached to a face that would tolerate being described. When you set the letter down in the exact posture of its finding, your fingertips retain a whisper of its perfume, and you are surprised to discover you are counting your own heartbeats without having chosen to.

=== node: dining_sideboard ===
The sideboard leans toward practical wealth: decanters squat on felt, glass tulips forever arrested mid‑bloom; a silver fish slice lounges beside a matched pair of ladles with the amiable gravitas of magistrates. Dust here is organized rather than accumulated, disturbed by someone who lifted, wiped, replaced as a hobby of dignity. Your reflection arrives in the curved flank of a decanter in triplicate, and you instinctively check whether your tie is straight, though nobody you respect would judge it in this light.

In a long drawer, linen nests with the texture of sentences, monogrammed with a labor that assumed a future. Beneath, a secret shallow compartment declares itself to fingers trained by curiosity. Inside: place cards with names you do not know, a pair of ivory counters etched with roses and thorns, and a folded note with nothing written inside, the paper creased as if a message once lived there and left through a hole you cannot see. When you close the drawer it complains the way old wood complains when it has not complained enough in the last month and hopes to catch up politely.

=== node: dining_drapes ===
You part the drapes as if waking a sleeper who has earned tenderness. Daylight enters with a face scrubbed raw by weeks of disuse; the window’s glass has collected the signatures of storms and resisting them made a frosted grammar. In the thin slice of brightness, dust invents its own choreography, each mote unsure whether the dance is invitation or indictment. The garden beyond has loitered into an argument with the brick path, and a blackbird perched on the fountain’s rim attempts a commentary it abandons halfway through.

The drapery cord is braided in the sailor’s manner, and when you pull, it remembers and resents a dozen prior hands. The fabric remembers heat better than light, and in your ear a whisper goes by that might be silk sliding over silk or a word that has found retiring an art. When the drapes settle again, the seam of light draws a straight white thought across the floorboards and the room pretends it did not sigh.

=== node: dining_mirror ===
The mirror understands that truth is a habit. Its mercury has boiled into islands; in the continents between, your face arrives like a theory untested. Standing slightly to the left of center, you banish a small halo of blur and discover the trick portrait painters stole: that the subject reveals himself in the margins, not the gaze. Behind you, the chandelier tallies crystals you had not bothered to number; a chair back offers a spine even your own might envy.

For a fraction the glass deepens, not the way glass deepens when a cloud moves, but the way a pond considers whether to keep the stone you just threw. You look away like a gentleman lies—smoothly, with enough truth left over to spend later—and when you return to the surface, your reflection behaves. Your handprint remains a ghost until the room takes it back into its old arithmetic of polish and time.
=== node: study_drawer ===
The drawer yields in increments the way some people do: a breath, a doubt, a decision. Inside, documents lie like well‑mannered guests; envelopes keep their mouths shut without requiring sealing wax to remind them. A penknife with a mother‑of‑pearl scale reflects your eye as a pale comma, a punctuation mark in search of the clause it deserves. In the back corner a small vellum notebook naps under the weight of a paperweight shaped like an egg, the sort of ornament one buys believing time itself might hatch from it if placed just so.

You open the notebook expecting lists and receive instead a few tight pages of observation: barometric readings; moonrise times; the days the jasmine misbehaved with its perfume as if bribed by a season not its own. Between them is tucked a newspaper clipping about a child found sleepwalking on a roof and “returned to the night” by a mother too wise to wake him. The date is older than your suit, younger than your parents. You replace the egg and discover your own fondness for the superstition it implies.

=== node: study_cabinet ===
Behind the glass, objects have arranged themselves into a curriculum vitae without benefit of a better metaphor: a compass whose needle has argued itself into fatigue; a magnifying lens with a scratch precisely where all important words prefer to stand; an iron key that acknowledges your hand with a cold so neat you forgive it. The cabinet smells faintly of camphor and charity bazaars.

When you lift the key it makes a sound that maps directly onto your palm, a tone with no seat in the polite range of frequencies. You imagine it freeing the library and, with it, a certain kind of problem that respects rules well enough to break them elegantly. A small memo card lies behind the hook: “Return to hook. Do not trust the desk.” The card’s corner is dog‑eared not by accident but by a ritual of emphasis, as if to teach future versions of you where to look again when memory refuses to behave.

=== node: study_diary ===
The diary chooses to be almost interesting. Its entries begin with inventories—coal, candles, invoices, the price of oranges—and then let slip the names of guests whose presence would make a dull party commit to being less dull: a cousin with opinions on seances, a rector given to admiring the library in a way that embarrasses both of them. In late spring, the tone fractures into small superstitions that refuse to call themselves such. Night noises take on footfall logic; a laugh becomes a line, then a verse. The pantry hatch rises once and then settles, unprompted, which the writer declines to call impossible and instead names “inconvenient to sleep.”

The final entry stops mid‑sentence, not a dramatic flourish but the sort of interruption that happens when the kettle at last boils, or when a thought opens a door and the door opens a better thought. The blot at the end is the shape of a continent a mapmaker would caution you about.

=== node: study_globe ===
You set the globe spinning and for a moment the continents become the sort of music a phonograph would milk from lacquer, latitude lines a stave, currents an undertow of rhythm. Your finger traces a voyage someone meant to take and did not; the line ends at a coast annotated by a hand that believed the ocean would become reasonable if only addressed correctly. A small pinprick of red varnish near the Caribbean has been scratched away with such care it could be accidental.

When the globe slows, it chooses to stop with New Orleans where a god might place his thumb to steady a game. You look for a signature and find none, then realize the signature is the manner of the object itself: sturdy, loved, useful in the way that turns knowledge into affection without anyone admitting that is what happened.
=== node: kitchen_range ===
The range is a monument to the idea that heat is character. Its iron doors hide blistered enamel like stories kept for grandchildren. You admire the arrangement of trivets and the logic by which someone trained their hands to know the precise intervals between steam and scorch. On the hob sits a kettle with a dent that looks like a decision; you feel the sudden, irrational need to fill it and audit its song. A long‑handled spoon rests as if granted a reprieve between soups.

Near the ash box, someone has traced a circle with a finger—an absentminded ritual or a small private spell against the indignities of damp coal. You stop yourself from wiping it away and thereby choosing sides in a quarrel years old.

=== node: kitchen_sink ===
Porcelain has its own geography: a map of fine cracks radiates from the drain like tributaries surrendering to a river. The taps creak into motion as if awakening a hinge asleep in its story, and water, reluctant at first, agrees to be summoned. The metal smell rides the stream and up your sleeves; in the bowl, a shadow shaped like a man’s shoulder slowly chooses to be just the color of the room. In the window above, the world presents a narrow slice of garden and a wider slice of sky, both pretending to be exactly where you left them.

Under the sink, a bottle holds vinegar so resolute it might be a sermon; beside it, a paper sack shelters a clutch of iron nails that have practiced patient rust and won.

=== node: kitchen_cups ===
You count cups to prove to yourself there is a census to be taken. Blue willow pairs with itself as if faithful by design; a chipped everyday mug leans a degree off plumb because a handle knows what it wants. A teacup saucer bears the faint ring of a glass too dear to scold. The order on the shelf results not from perfectionism but from a truce among habits. You find the sort of saucer that makes you imagine a person reaching for it with authority and setting it down with grace, not because grace is easy but because the room requires it.
=== node: parlor_piano ===
You lift the fallboard and the keys grin like a disciplined choir. The first note you strike does not exactly sound; it proposes a sound and then remembers how to be polite about it. Dust shivers off and resettles, a quiet snowfall. You play the shape of a hymn without committing to doctrine, and the house listens in a way that tells you it would have opinions if asked directly. The lower register holds a mild sea sickness, possibly from a life spent vaguely out of tune with its own history; the treble tinkles in the cautious manner of a glassware conversation.

When you close the cover, your fingers do not quite want to leave, which is either nostalgia borrowing your hands or the instrument drawing its own curtain.

=== node: parlor_portrait ===
She is not beautiful so much as inevitable. The painter has caught a mouth that would rather correct you later than argue now, and eyes that prefer to audit the room in a quiet dialect of arithmetic. The background is properly anonymous, which convinces you your memory has invented a settee and a book. In the corner the signature refuses to compete with the subject, choosing initials and a date in a brown that does not blush.

When you take a step to the left, the eyes do not follow; instead the light along the varnish edits itself slightly, and your mind performs the trick on your behalf. A crackle of age crazes the surface into a network modestly proud of years that did not quite behave.

=== node: parlor_soap ===
Beneath the glass dome, the soap has been both preserved and betrayed. It wears the dust of respect in a geometry that implies it has been lifted and replaced often enough to learn manners. The violet perfume makes a case for itself that the room respectfully declines to argue. When you remove the dome, the fragrance insists on a sharper memory: hands in cold water, an apron, a moment before company arrives in which one forgives and is forgiven for no reason but that it helps.
=== node: conservatory_bench ===
The wrought bench is that most rare of objects: something that forgives the body. Its curves place your spine in a posture your childhood piano teacher would have applauded and triangulate your view so that the palm becomes—unexpectedly—handsome. The iron has learned to be warm in the day and less discouraging in the night. When you sit, a fine grit on the seat betrays last week’s argument between breeze and dust cloth.

On the step nearby, a leaf has dried into a shade of brown that cannot be taught, only survived. You let your hand rest on the bench a breath longer than practical and feel the specific way metal returns your heat.

=== node: conservatory_fig ===
The creeping fig has not asked, but it has learned the art of petition. Its tendrils test the glass seam with a patience that would shame any litigant. A small new leaf unrolls with the drama nature affords herself when indoors, green so clean it seems to ring when looked at. You pinch a stem to reconcile the scent with a memory you cannot place; the plant declines to flatter you and keeps its counsel.

On the sill, a smear of old soil describes a landscape that once included a pot, a child, and a decision to hope.

=== node: conservatory_rust ===
The watering can’s hole is perfect the way compromise is not. Rust saucers the floor tile beneath it, an alchemy of orange that would be vulgar if it were not so exacting. You trace the ellipse with a fingertip and leave a cleaner line that the room accepts without comment. A droplet on the can’s lip holds for a brave moment and then commits to gravity as if endorsing its campaign for office.
=== node: nursery_cradle ===
You set a forefinger on the cradle’s rim as if touching the shoulder of a thought. It moves in the least way and then decides to move a little more, negotiating with the room the terms of its own relevance. A hair—not yours—lies against the coverlet and lifts when you sigh. The cradle knows the shape of emptiness like a profession and accepts you as an unpaid intern.

The urge to tuck in something imaginary spreads through your hands like warmth; you override it gently, set the cradle still, and stand as if someone were watching your kindness for accounting purposes.

=== node: nursery_mobile ===
Three tin balloons twirl in a private weather, practicing shadows on the wall that prefer to be mistaken for animals. You blow once, lightly, and the mobile replies with an argument for circularity. The thread from which it hangs has been mended in two places, knots set by hands recently enough to hold your attention, long ago enough to discourage questions.

When the motion tiredly dies, one balloon faces east as if summoned for roll‑call.

=== node: nursery_laughter ===
The laughter is placed incorrectly on some axis your brain considers non‑negotiable: not beyond, not behind, not in the crib, not in the hall, but in the wall itself or in the precise middle of the air between you and the wallpaper hares. It is not cruel, which is somehow worse. You say “hello” and the quiet embraces your syllables like an aunt who means well. The silence that follows is owned by something that does not enjoy being addressed and for which names feel like rudeness.
=== node: library_case ===
The case’s glass has stored fingertips in a ledger of smudges; each line item confesses to wanting the candle or the book or both. The lock turns with the honest reluctance of a mechanism that has a right to expect better oil. Inside, the black candle absorbs more light than it could reasonably fit; the book refuses to weigh less even when held in one hand, a discourtesy that sells its seriousness. You do not strike a match. You close the case because it seems polite not to change anything alone.

=== node: library_tome ===
Leafing the tome feels like moving through a house inside a book inside a prayer. The script favors a hand less interested in beauty than in getting things exact. A passage on ordered acts reminds you that rituals are what polite societies invent when they cannot afford accidents. The margin shows a tidy checkmark beside a diagram of three circles and a line that insists the first act be a light, the second a reading, the third a wound. Somewhere in your chest an organ unrelated to anatomy agrees. The author never gives a proper noun to what the rite opposes; the avoidance reads like respect learned the hard way.

=== node: library_seam ===
You press along the seam and feel the concealed latch admit that it has wondered how long you would take. The panel gives, not like a trap but like a professional doing his job. Behind it the crawl space smells of old paper warmed by breath, of dust and other people’s decisions. Your lamp produces a narrow road into the wall and the wall accepts the appointment.
=== node: master_dresser ===
Drawers open on a life that was edited carefully: sachets with lavender surrendered to history, a fan whose ribs preserve air from three summers ago, a button kept for thirty years on the evidence that someday a particular cuff would require it. The mirror in the lid returns your face with the sort of patience that implies you could improve if you chose to and that it would understand your failure if you did not.

=== node: master_dagger ===
The dagger’s polish is recent and precise, wiped in small circles by someone who believed in circles. The edge persuades your eye to believe in lines thinner than honesty. You lift it by the hilt and feel the balance argue for acts it would prefer not to name. There is a nick near the guard, a record of some day when metal met objection and persisted.

=== node: master_perfume ===
Unstoppering the bottle releases a small society: top notes that behave like gossips at a funeral, hearts that perform sincerity, a base that nods as if remembering the ending before the story begins. On the vanity, a powder puff holds the fingerprint of someone who declined to be photographed and succeeded.
=== node: boiler_leak ===
You trace the leak along the pipe with your eyes and then your fingers, becoming for a moment the kind of person who believes the truth can be learned by following its wetness home. At a joint the drip achieves the frequency of a metronome measuring a slow waltz for one. Your knuckle taps steel; the sound returns hollowed out and a little ashamed, as if the pipe has been lying about its confidence.

=== node: boiler_coal ===
Counting lumps should be futile, but the act draws a grid over your fear and numbers stumble helpfully into the squares. One heap has slumped into a style of repose that implies it will not be woken; another arranges itself into the back of an animal that would run if only it could remember which way legs go. A small scrap of sack twine makes a letter of the alphabet against a brick and refuses to say which.
=== node: catacombs_6 ===
The passage compresses then relaxes, a lung neither entirely yours nor entirely stone’s. A chalk arrow on the wall—yours, surely—appears in a place you do not remember leaving it. Perhaps there is a kindness in echoes and chalk that never makes it upstairs.

=== node: catacombs_7 ===
Two narrow alcoves present shelves of dust that have disciplined themselves into strata. In the grit a footprint that could be yours decides it is not. Somewhere water rehearses for a role it will never get to play above ground.

=== node: catacombs_8 ===
Your light finds a nail in a mortar seam. The nail declines to explain itself. A moth passes the beam and becomes an essay about mortality, then proceeds with its evening.

=== node: catacombs_9 ===
The floor remembers stairs that no longer exist and simulates them for your ankle with conviction. A thread hangs from the ceiling and you forgive it for doing nothing.

=== node: catacombs_10 ===
The last bend opens into a low mouth of stone. Air moves from right to left as if obeying script notation. You could almost believe the sound ahead is a page turning. The ritual chamber waits.
=== node: end_madness_3 ===
You begin by counting the flowers on the wallpaper in the nursery and end by apologizing to them for the arithmetic’s poor manners. The air folds itself into a shawl, and you wear it, and you feel properly attended. Someone speaks from the wall and says the word “north” with a tone you have only ever heard in recipes. You agree to stand in one spot until the house forgives you for a thing you did not do, and the spot obliges by feeling important. When, at last, neighbors persuade you toward a chair, the legs understand more about directions than you do; you nod because nodding is the one thing everyone agrees is still polite.

=== node: end_madness_4 ===
The lullaby starts sensibly, the way a key fits a lock, and ends with phonemes that insist sleep and waking can be friends if they agree not to be introduced. You hum to the room and the room hums back, an honest duet. The cradle keeps time, and the rocking horse counts measures in hoof‑taps you register along your bones. The constable calls you by a name that you accept because names are hats; you can wear any unless rain is forecast.

=== node: end_madness_5 ===
Rabbits know numbers differently. You practice their system until the moons on the paper become coins and the coins become mouths and the mouths, gracefully, refuse to eat you. You are grateful for the policy. On the landing you explain to the wallpaper that long division is an unkindness in an unkind world, and it forgives you for the lesson. Later, walking home between two women who take you seriously, you do not recall where the street ends, only that your feet invent a frontier your toes decline to patrol.

=== node: end_madness_6 ===
Books are lakes and you have become fond of drowning. The tome’s paragraphs stack like bluesmen on a stage, each insisting the next will cure you and each delivering only a more meticulous ache. Your voice, when you read aloud to test the room’s echo, returns with a new vowel you did not authorize, and you make space for it because hospitality is the last virtue you intend to surrender. When the words refuse to mean only themselves, you let them mean you instead, and you find a certain peace in becoming an appendix tucked into someone else’s chapter.

=== node: end_scarred_3 ===
Leaning over the rail seems merely curious until the iron reminds you it remembers winter better than you. The drop is shallow in an absolute sense and deep in the one that afterward keeps company with stairs. You land in geometry: shrubs become angles, path becomes a proof. Standing takes a while but happens, as such things do, and then walking does also, because walking is stubborn. Later, rain announces itself in your bones, and you nod and say hello the way one greets an old teacher in a station.

=== node: end_scarred_4 ===
Water and iron and a foot placed honestly: these are the ingredients for a lesson. The slip begins as a mischief and concludes in a convincing argument. You meet the floor, the floor introduces you to a pipe, the pipe suggests you reconsider the arrangement of your days. Breathing turns into a task and then into a decision; you make the decision as often as necessary. Up the stairs, you learn the rate at which a curse becomes a prayer if said kindly. You will walk less elegantly, but you will call it a style and the world will agree.

=== node: end_scarred_5 ===
The pit doesn’t announce itself; it merely proposes physics. You accept. The ankle composes an essay on leverage that it submits to your nerves for peer review; they pass it grudgingly. Lying on the cool stone, you discover new definitions for the words “up” and “enough” and choose to use them only conversationally. In time you stand, and in longer time you climb, and at the top the air permits you to say something rude without consequence. You take the permit and frame it in your chest.

=== node: end_scarred_6 ===
On the stair a tiny twist of nothing-at-all makes a case for attention. Your foot sides with it. Pain writes your name in capital letters up the shin, then goes around again for flourish. You sit on three steps because two would be melodrama and four would be indulgent, and in that posture you discover the specific moral courage required to stand again in front of no one. Upstairs, the hall declines to notice; downstairs, the boiler declines to sympathize. Outside, the day continues like a man making tea.
=== node: catacombs_11 ===
The turn here is modest, almost domestic, as if corridors could decide to be hallways in a house that apologized often and meant it. On the left a shallow niche holds brick dust in a neat crescent, the kind of punctuation that suggests a sentence once stood upright there and quietly lay down. Your chalk line from earlier does not appear; instead you find a smear that might be yours if your hand had been more tired. The air cools by a small degree and your teeth inquire about the barometer like cousins writing from far away.

=== node: catacombs_12 ===
Roots expose themselves like handwriting in the mortar, honest about the direction they intend to travel. A drip insists it is not a clock and then performs impeccably as one. The floor has learned a slope that would not trouble a cart but troubles the patient arrangement of your ankles. If you extinguished your light you suspect the dark would not change; you do not conduct the experiment because some knowledge is merely the expensive way to confirm a guess.

=== node: catacombs_13 ===
The passage narrows, a polite request for you to decide what you mean by shoulders. On the wall a chalk X, not yours, has been fingered into a star and then into a thought; you contribute nothing, which feels like collaboration of a high order. Somewhere ahead a sound like a page turning cannot locate its book. You rehearse your own name out loud softly and accept the echo’s offer to pronounce it a little differently.

=== node: catacombs_14 ===
Here the brick wears a glaze the color of stalled thunder. A wind chooses to be invented by you and then obliges by finding your ear in precisely the way a librarian finds the table where you have spoken one syllable too loudly. You touch a joint with one finger and the grit refuses to be anything else. In the dust below, a crescent of something metallic has made its print and then left, a moon arranging alibis.

=== node: catacombs_15 ===
At an elbow in the corridor a bare patch of floor declares it has recently been somebody’s idea of clean. This is not reassuring. Scuff marks trace the letter S, then another, and a double line that could be only impatience. If the house upstairs is poetry, this is ledger; yet even here the bookkeeping remembers to leave room for a flourish where none belongs. You breathe like a person counting and then decide, nobly, to believe in luck instead.

=== node: catacombs_16 ===
Mortar has been repointed at differing times by hands that did not consult, and the wall reads like a correspondence between cousins. The ceiling lowers experimentally to test your politeness; you pass and it relents, a fraction. Your lamp throws a long vowel into shadow and the tunnel pronounces it back at you with an accent. When you scrape your boot, the sound travels ahead as if interviewing the dark for a job the dark already has.

=== node: catacombs_17 ===
There is a niche with a plank across it: once a shelf, now an assertion. Two nails at the edge present heads filed down by use or attention. The plank flexes when you press and then adopts a dignity disproportionate to its task. You permit it. The air has picked up the taste of old coins again; you hold it on your tongue to see if it has learned any new tricks. It has not, but it pretends gamely.

=== node: catacombs_18 ===
The tunnel kinks as if it distrusts straight lines on principle. Your light catches a cobweb that has deigned to be architecture; the spider, wisely, is not auditioning. Beneath it, a brick bears a pale scratch at an angle—a mark that means continue to someone and stop to someone else. You choose neither and walk with the gait of a person reserving judgment.

=== node: catacombs_19 ===
A trickle finds the low side of the floor and volunteers to be a river for the length of the corridor. You accompany it respectfully. Your breath condenses and your body, fickle conductor that it is, composes a second weather in the lamp’s halo. A hair—not yours—lies on the ground and cannot explain itself. You accept this as one accepts a foreign coin in change: with confusion and a foolish gratitude.

=== node: catacombs_20 ===
Two turns negotiate and arrive at a compromise so elegant you forgive them both. Ahead, a breath of air that has never met the upstairs world rehearses its manners on your cheek. Behind, your chalk becomes less persuasive and more myth. When you stop to listen, the tunnel refuses to be accused; it is simply here, it says, and will be here later, and you may do as you like.
=== node: catacombs_21 ===
The brick here has learned to keep its counsel, pitted and sure in a way that declines metaphor. A smear along the wall marks where a shoulder—yours or someone beloved by the dark—once asked for tolerance and received enough of it to pass. Your lamp makes a kindly geometry of simple things: a bump in mortar becomes a hill; a thread becomes a road; your hand becomes a letter you can read without training. The air tastes as though someone briefly boiled a coin and let the steam think about you.

=== node: catacombs_22 ===
The corridor’s floor favors the left, so your foot does also, which would be companionship if it were not merely obedience. A slug has written a cursive line across a stone and the stone, obliging, has not erased it. You practice a theory that the tunnel always grew exactly this direction and no other, and the tunnel, delighted to be understood, elaborates without waiting for a question. You are honest with yourself about the direction you are headed and find honesty both heavier and easier than you planned.

=== node: catacombs_23 ===
Someone, long ago or last week, knocked a little divot in the corner of a brick as if to prove that change exists. You touch it and it reports what it knows: not much, and enough. Your breath moves ahead of you like a diplomat arranging handshakes; yours returns behind like a clerk tallying the handshakes afterward. The ceiling lowers as a test you pass by choosing not to take personally what stone does to everyone eventually.

=== node: catacombs_24 ===
Lime bloom powders the wall and gifts your palm the lesson you did not ask for about minerals and weather and waiting. The floor slips into levelness with a grace that makes you suspicious of it in exactly the way you are suspicious of compliments. A beetle, somewhere, minding its business, proposes a turbulence you let be. Your light pauses on a bit of rag that might once have been a ribbon and then on a nail that has learned the art of continuing.

=== node: catacombs_25 ===
Your foot finds, then rejects, a pebble’s argument for infancy. In a niche, dust has organized itself into strata the way time insists on customs. When you stand still, the stillness stands with you but makes no promises. Your name said out loud comes back thinner and more precise, as if things down here take reputations seriously and nicknames are frowned upon.

=== node: catacombs_26 ===
The passage sways—not in reality, perhaps, but in the portion of reality that takes orders from breath. You put your hand on the wall and the wall remembers you while remembering all the other hands it has known, which is how walls practice mercy. A hairline crack runs from floor to mid‑wall and stops the way a sentence stops when the writer thought better of it and left the best part to a reader’s imagination.

=== node: catacombs_27 ===
In the half‑shadow the brickwork invents the idea of tiles; you admire the ambition and decline to correct it. Your lamp throws a long simple shape down the corridor as if laying a measure of music across stone and asking the stone whether it can hum. The stone hums, of course, and the key happens to be one you can keep.

=== node: catacombs_28 ===
You feel the floor as a polite slope, which is how good floors tell you truths: without melodrama. A scrape on one wall draws a diagonal, then decides against the commitment and softens near the end. It looks like the beginning of a map or the end of one. You choose beginning, because choosing endings without provocation is a habit you have weaned yourself from.

=== node: catacombs_29 ===
An old nail head is a small moon embedded in stone, and your lamp’s angle gifts it the phase appropriate to your mood. A web nearby confects a constellation no astronomer would dare to publish. The corridor’s breath changes a degree as if a door somewhere learned to love its hinge again. You measure the change against your shoulder and your shoulder agrees to keep its counsel.

=== node: catacombs_30 ===
Two bricks have learned to sit ill with their neighbors; the joint between them keeps its distance like a quarrel neither wishes to win. The mortar’s sand grits under your palm like the grit of an apology offered late and accepted anyway. The air is a calendar without dates, moving forward because that is the one thing it knows how to do without being asked.

=== node: catacombs_31 ===
In the corner, two spider lines meet to sign a treaty. You refuse to interpret this as omen because omens prefer to apply for the job and you have not posted it. Your footfalls describe to the stone a person of no particular consequence who intends to be gentle. Stone tends to promote such persons sooner than they expect.

=== node: catacombs_32 ===
You pass the kind of silence that has practiced enough to be mistaken for a skill. Your lamp’s heat draws a fine wetness out of the stone and the scent is limestone after rain and also the smell of a cellar in a story in which something is kept safe and something is kept that should have been taken outside years ago. You proceed, and the corridor agrees to be generous about it.

=== node: catacombs_33 ===
Here the wall has grown a tiny cave of its own, a cup the size of a field mouse imagined by a poet who resents being asked whether field mice can read. You pass a drip that has chosen not to fall yet and admire its discipline. The tunnel reads you and concludes that your ambition is to leave politely; it approves.

=== node: catacombs_34 ===
Your hand grazes a seam, then stays there the way a thought stays when the rest of the mind has decided not to help. You do not press; the stone has enough to do without your experiments. The dust on the floor makes a soft sound under your heel and you forgive yourself for liking it.

=== node: catacombs_35 ===
The corridor widens in a way that might be relief and might be prelude. The air boils gently, not like water but like a choir with good manners warming their voices. Your shoulders relax because they are loyal and want to believe the best. The wall on the right leans a degree toward you, and you accept its confidence with the gravity you try to keep for gifts. Ahead, the black hum acquires a timbre you could almost mistake for your name said kindly by someone who has survived you.
=== node: dining_chandelier ===
You stand beneath the chandelier and discover that dust is a form of soft weather. Each crystal drop has learned a lesson about light and then elected to forget it in favor of memory; the facets now carry only a faded intention to refract. The brass arms reach in a geometry that would be arrogance if it were new but now reads as dignity, like the posture of an old dancer thinking of a role. Near the ceiling a cobweb has cured into lace. You consider the ladder that must once have accompanied the ritual of polishing and imagine the hands that held a cloth around every little prism while the house breathed lemon oil and a guest laughed downstairs. A breath of air you would swear did not exist a moment ago stirs two of the crystals into a chiming that pretends to be coincidence long enough for you to accept it.

=== node: dining_chairs ===
Counting chairs should be a pastime for a better afternoon, yet here you are: twelve seats for twelve stories you will never hear. Upholstery has learned the weight of different sorts of guests—one chair sits a bit lower in the bones, another resists collapse as if practiced in disapproval. On the back of the nearest, a thread unspools from a seam and reassures you that time passes even in curated rooms. You pull the chair an inch from the table and it answers in a note that reminds you of shoes on a church floor, of a cough held until the sermon yields. You replace it exactly and the room nods, or perhaps that is your own head obeying etiquette.

=== node: study_window ===
The sash sticks with the reluctance of someone asked to tell the truth. When it releases, the outside air does not so much enter as observe you, cool and a little damp from the trees’ breath. The glass wobbles the garden into the kind of dream a judge would strike from the record for being too helpful. Along the sill a line of dust has been parted by a fingertip, recently enough that the motes have not yet negotiated a truce. You set your palm there and feel the notch a carpenter left in 1803 when he thought no one would ever mind; it comforts you in ways you take as evidence of being the sort of person who has always liked stories better than facts.

=== node: study_rug ===
You lift the corner with the unease of a guest lifting the corner of a confession. The rug yields an inventory: the threadbare honesty of a small hole darned twice, a ghost of a spill that once smelled of tea, a scatter of grit like the arithmetic of a patient child. The floorboard beneath is not quite square with its neighbor and so becomes the protagonist of a quiet crime: footsteps have mapped a route from desk to cabinet and back, a pilgrimage made enough times to write a psalm in scuffs. You lower the rug as if returning a book to the shelf in a library that prefers to be loved by people who do not raise their voices.

=== node: kitchen_icebox ===
The icebox breath speaks with an accent of iron and sweet milk left too long to argue with itself. Shelves, scrubbed and punished, wear the pale scratches of worthy labor. In the tray, a trophy shard of ice has survived the indignities of summer by pretending to be a jewel; you tip it, and it surrenders a sound like the end of a small promise. The door’s seal remembers hands and offers yours the same resistance, a polite warning that the past is cold for reasons it will only tell if asked in the language of hinges.

=== node: kitchen_spices ===
The spice jars retain their labels the way names cling to a family even after the stories have gone elsewhere. Cinnamon remembers winter with smugness; cloves keep vigil like stern aunts; nutmeg proposes optimism inappropriate to the room. One lid comes off with a sigh and the powder inside throws the room back a decade without permission. You sneeze quietly and the kitchen forgives you by smelling briefly of cookie and of ships that used to come here when the world was a map drawn by men who had never once been correct on purpose.

=== node: pantry_labels ===
Some labels have resigned, ink bled into anonymity; others hold their ground with the tenacity of a name notarized in triplicate. Peaches, 1919; beans, the kind that promise thrift; a medicine bottle demoted to vinegar. A jar of something once red has the honesty to be now brown and you admire the commitment. You touch the paper with one finger and it flakes in the precise manner of historic paper, which is to say it mocks your vitamins and your youth. Behind a row, you find a label turned inward, as if privacy were possible among pickles.

=== node: parlor_clock ===
You wind the clock with the deference one pays a widow. The key turns and somewhere gears consent to be required again, a bureaucracy waking up and stamping the correct form. The tick resumes not as a noise but as a courtesy, as if time had been waiting for your admission that you would like to be counted after all. The face shows no special eagerness to prefer one minute over another, but the minute you are in feels a touch better than the one you left, which is how clocks make friends of people they cannot know.

=== node: conservatory_panes ===
The glass eddies your reflection until you are persuaded to be someone adjacent to yourself—a cousin with better posture. Condensation has drawn tracks in the previous weeks and dried into cartography only the plants consult. You lay a fingertip against a pane and the cold surprises you in the gentle manner of a dog come to rest with its head on your ankle. Beyond, the garden performs itself with fewer lines than it rehearsed, which you choose to interpret as humility.

=== node: cellar_grate ===
You crouch at the iron grate set over a square void that smells of damp and the arithmetic of load‑bearing walls. Threads of spider silk anchor to the bars and then to the darkness in a pattern you refuse to call a web because you are practicing, at last, not naming every small thing. A draft eddies up like a note from a throat clearing before a speech. You whisper a polite apology for listening and the grate answers with the soft complaint of rust discovering itself.

=== node: landing_draft ===
The draft is an informant with exquisite manners. It moves along the baseboard from the library toward the nursery and then, reconsidering, seeks the stairs as a brook seeks an easier gradient. You lean your ear into the corridor and it tells you a secret in a language that has no verbs; you translate it poorly and feel proud. The carpet responds by raising a nap against the flow and then smooths itself again when you step back, as if you had never been the sort of person to interrupt air doing its work.

=== node: bedroom_a_trunk ===
The trunk is too heavy with biography to be merely furniture. Leather corners give under your thumb as if making a small appointment. Inside, tissue paper lifts the smell of lavender and paper itself—dried pulp with a sense of chronology. There is a shawl with a hole worn into a star at the shoulder, and beneath it, a photograph whose subjects have consented to be remembered by people who will never know their names. You return each item precisely because precision is the closest thing to kindness you are sure of.

=== node: bedroom_b_picture ===
Behind the picture the wall has paled in a rectangle like a ghost that refuses to haunt more space than allotted. The nail has become a small iron moon embedded in plaster, haloed by dust that tried to keep the frame and failed. On the picture’s back, in pencil, a date and a phrase that could be a toast or a warning: June 12—Be brave. You take that generosity as intended for the house and permit yourself to be its courier.

=== node: nursery_toys ===
The cupboard concedes a delay and then opens like a child showing you a secret. Blocks with letters practice the word HOUSE and then, dissatisfied, scatter into nonsense that nevertheless feels readable. A stuffed rabbit has been repaired with stitches small enough to be mistaken for prayer. You straighten a tin soldier that refuses to stand and it falls again in the precise rhythm of certain hymns. In the dust, someone drew a line and then another perpendicular to it, and your heart obeys without agreement.

=== node: library_cards ===
The card catalog smells of old order. You run a finger along the wooden rods and each drawer answers with a private little cluck, like doves composing a sentence. Categories confide in shorthand: the owner made compromises between geography and desire you recognize as almost reasonable. One card bears a greasy thumbprint at the author’s initial as if someone had been about to look for a work by title and then remembered the author was the only index that could be trusted.

=== node: master_bath ===
The taps turn with a brief reluctance as befits history. Pipes mutter opinions up the wall and hot water, called, arrives much the way old friends do: slightly late and carrying a story about the street. Porcelain offers you a dissertation in hairline cracks, all the zigzags of a life conducted in rooms both grand and small. Steam proposes magnanimity. In the mirror the silvering has failed along the edges in a way that makes your face seem accompanied by friendly shadows.

=== node: boiler_gauge ===
You tap the glass with a knuckle and the needle quivers as if embarrassed to be seen in public. The gauge bears a maker’s mark from a city that believes it invented patience; you suspect it might be right. Inside the dial, condensation has written a scripture of tiny arcs that evaporate before you can confirm your comprehension. You declare the pressure satisfactory because the room prefers sentences with that word in them.

=== node: stairs_handprint ===
The smear is not paint and not soot; it is the residue of a narrative that has not finished learning itself. Your palm finds the exact width of it and the wall does not object to the comparison. You hold it there a second longer than seems reasonable and grant yourself the superstition that the house tolerated you because you honored what it tried to remember.
=== node: dining_china ===
Porcelain tells on a household. Here the plates wear a hairline crazing like fine frost spread by a winter that kept its own counsel. You lift one, feeling the feathering along the rim where fingers once steadied servings through conversations that practiced politeness like a craft. The pattern is a pastoral done in cobalt—lambs, a brook—and the brook’s bend looks a shade too much like a noose if you tip it toward the light. On the underside a maker’s mark insists on a century and your own hands insist on washing, as if time could be undone with hot water and a cloth. You set the plate back and it clicks softly against its mates; a bell struck in miniature, announcing for no one in particular that someone has remembered how to leave things as they were.

=== node: dining_floorboard ===
Near the head of the table a board gives a fractional sigh when you place your weight and then, delighted to have been noticed, learns to do it again. You kneel and press your thumb along the seam and the wood describes a story of nights paced while tea thought better of boiling. Dust gathers in the join like a note half stuck under a door; you consider lifting it and do not. The room approves your refusal by returning the floor to silence, and you find yourself grateful to a timber whose chief virtue is to forget your existence upon request.

=== node: study_wainscot_tap ===
A knuckle tap draws a different voice from each panel—hollow here, stubborn there—like a set of uncles at a holiday insisting on the superiority of their preferred tobacco. One spot returns a tone you recognize as the cousin of doors; not a secret, exactly, but an admission that secrets exist. You do not pry; you annotate the map in your head in the ink of a librarian who expects to return. The varnish has cracked into an alluvial map and your lamp glosses it into little rivers that go nowhere and still please the eye.

=== node: study_inbox ===
The leather tray holds a correspondence whose urgency has drained away, leaving behind the dignity of paper that agreed to be written on. Envelopes align like teeth; you imagine the bite of a decision taken and then shelved. One note bears only a date and the word “Boiler,” underlined twice and underlined again in exasperation. You turn it over and the back is clean, which is the sort of hope a person could waste a decade on. You place it topmost because hierarchy is a kindness when time has lost interest.

=== node: kitchen_drawer ===
Inside, an orchestra of tools dozes: a melon baller that has retired into nostalgia; a corkscrew still proud of its two good stories; a tangle of string that could yet rescue a tart from disaster. The wood at the drawer’s front is lighter where thumbs have asked it to change its mind a thousand times. Beneath a floury tea towel you find a recipe clipped from a paper; the measurements are sensible; the instructions assume you know what you’re doing. You replace it exactly and, for an instant, suspect you do.

=== node: kitchen_knife_rack ===
The knives sit obedient and slightly judgmental, edges turned inward as if to agree that violence is best kept private. Handles remember hands in a way that neither flatters nor condemns. You lift one and feel the past’s invitation to be decisive; you put it back because the present requires you to be careful. On the rail a fleck of something brown insists on being called cinnamon. You indulge it.

=== node: pantry_peaches ===
The jar’s peaches are August frozen into amber, each crescent a fossil of sun. The syrup holds light and returns it in an old dialect. A label, once neat, has drunk the humidity and now staggers; the handwriting still knows how to stand up straight. You tilt the jar and watch a slow galaxy of sugar float, the kind of spectacle that would convert a miser to wonder. Replace it, and it grumbles softly in the way jars do when given back their shelf.

=== node: pantry_vinegar ===
The vinegar’s dignity has outlived everyone who thought to put their name on the paper band. It breathes austerity with a promise of salvation if you will merely permit it. You imagine it rescuing a sauce and then an evening—then dismiss the thought because the evening you are in has other rescuers to consider. The glass neck catches your lamp and throws back a thin coin of light onto the opposite shelf where dust receives it like alms.

=== node: parlor_armchair ===
The armchair knows how to take a person without keeping them, which is a furniture virtue and a human one. The cushion remembers a shape a little larger than yours; you sit anyway and the springs lean into their work with a sigh that accomplishes the difficult trick of being both cynical and kind. From here the portrait regards you less as an intruder and more as an understudy. You stand before the chair can become too certain about your intentions and the upholstery forgives you for leaving.

=== node: parlor_mantel_note ===
On a slip of paper tucked under the clock’s foot a pencil hand has written, “Remember the lamp.” No one has, or everyone did and the reminder became the relic of a duty successfully completed. The mantel bears three faint rings and a burn you can lay a finger across; you do and it fits, and that is the whole meaning of that gesture. On the hearth, ash has arranged itself into the map of a city that would not survive an afternoon of competent governance.

=== node: conservatory_condensation ===
Condensation ran here in the week just past, drawing lines of argument down the pane and pooling at the bevel until the sun reprimanded it into transparency. Your fingertip traces the remembered riverbed and comes away clean; there is satisfaction in the knowledge that you are not required to fix anything. Leaves press their flat hands against the other side of the glass as if to request parole. You deny them with the gravity of a Commissioner of Plants and proceed.

=== node: conservatory_root_heave ===
The floor has learned a slow wave. Between two tiles a root shoulders through, pale and patient, like a sermon that keeps returning until the congregation consents. You could step there and ruin your ankle’s friendship with you, so you do not. The bench approves by staying quiet. You admire the root’s confidence and make a small vow to earn yours.

=== node: cellar_drip_timing ===
Drip, space, drip—too even to be random, too irregular to be mechanical; the house speaks its metronome while the basement keeps time in a language older than music. You count six, then forget and begin again; the forgetting is the point. Somewhere the water chooses a new path and the measure alters, as if the stone had turned a page and the conductor had not. Your breath syncs because breath is a follower by trade.

=== node: cellar_step_wear ===
The steps confess their biographies: shallow hollows where hurried feet have chosen the path of least geography; a deeper gouge at the turn where boots once dragged consequence down into the heat. Your lamp coaxes a sheen from grit ground so fine it might be the memory of grit rather than the thing itself. You put your foot exactly where a thousand others did and find no curse waiting there—only the mundanity of descent.

=== node: landing_carpet_nap ===
The carpet raises its nap one way, smoothes the other, a tide you can command with a palm. A faint track runs in a diagonal that does not respect the logic of doorways; habit laid it down and habit deepened it. You consider kneeling to smell the wool and decide against it for reasons you could explain but prefer not to. Drafts confuse the pile into little eddies and you feel unreasonably fond of them.

=== node: bedroom_a_bed_springs ===
Beds give sermons after they are done with their marriages. This one speaks in the squeak of a spring made honest by fatigue and in the low settle of boards content to carry guilt without complaint. You press a knee and the sound makes a promise to wake the landing if ever the hour requires it. The coverlet purls a little at the seam where a hand worried it on long nights; you smooth it and the cloth remembers it can lie flat.

=== node: library_ladder_rail ===
The brass rail hums in your hand, heat from your skin returning as if metal could afford sentiment. The ladder rolls with the decorum of a butler, a glide that forgives the sins of ankles. You stop before reaching the top shelf because a person in your situation should resist the urge to climb toward certainty. Dust above eye height holds the precise arithmetic of neglect; you decline to disturb it and accept the gentler arithmetic of caution instead.

Dust above eye height holds the precise arithmetic of neglect; you decline to disturb it and accept the gentler arithmetic of caution instead.
=== node: foyer_console_tray ===
The silvered tray on the console gives back a clouded reflection, a version of you edited for eras you have not earned. Scratches describe a constellation that must once have held a teapot, a letter opener, a life with schedules. You touch the rim and the tarnish agrees to be a map for a second and then forgives itself and darkens. A visiting card slides a whisper under your fingertip; there is a name embossed that asks to be trusted and a corner worn down by nervousness. The tray remembers hospitality the way bodies remember songs: insufficiently, and yet with grace.

=== node: foyer_calling_cards ===
Names on stiff paper practice their postures: Mr. so‑and‑so, Miss such‑and‑such, the interlocking scripts of alliances that wore gloves. One card holds a smudge of something like ash, and you make a small theatre in which it touched a hearth and picked up the day’s language. Another has a corner folded in, an old code for “I called and you were out,” and you fold it back as if you could put an afternoon to rights.

=== node: garden_fountain ===
The fountain has become a bowl for sky. Leaves collect and make an alphabet for birds. You lean in and your face arrives in ripples that precede you, a child of physics and a stranger to vanity. A coin at the bottom is no one’s wish now, only metal negotiating with lime; you consider rescuing it and suspect the fountain has learned to be content with charity it does not have to spend.

=== node: garden_jasmine ===
Off‑season and unreasonable, the jasmine insists. A sweetness rinses the air and your mouth refuses to call it pleasant only because it is honest. You crush a leaf and the scent that comes is green and unapologetic, a reminder that floral is a kind of courage. Up close, the vine’s grip on stone is a negotiation of years, the kind that makes property law jealous.

=== node: stair_handrail_satin ===
Under your palm the rail is a sermon about persistence; wood polished by the agreements of a thousand mornings. The satin texture answers your skin with the intimacy of a vowel. You slide a step and hear the staircase sing the note it saves for careful people.

=== node: bedroom_a_bible ===
The Bible opens itself as if persuaded by habit. A page ruffles to a psalm that means more to the paper than to you, and yet the verse throws a net and brings up, impossibly, a small calm. In the margin someone has underlined the word valley in a hand that did not sob while writing. A ribbon marks another page whose number is also a date if you are willing to count years like blessings.

=== node: bedroom_a_window_crack ===
In the paint along the sash, a crack has drawn a river delta. You place your fingertip at the mouth and trace the tributaries backward to a source you cannot see. Outside, the garden negotiates shade; inside, your breath fogs and clears the glass in the rhythm of a person pretending not to be afraid.

=== node: bedroom_a_closet ===
The closet’s breath is old linen and the polite ghosts of cedar. A hanger ticks as if time here is a separate instrument. On a high shelf a hatbox keeps a circular secret; you leave it unopened with a kindness that costs you nothing and will still be remembered by someone later.

=== node: bedroom_b_wardrobe_linen ===
Folded sheets have kept their vows better than most people. Edges align; a faint scent of starch promises a discipline that would be inappropriate for love and perfect for sleep. You touch a monogram and a family appears briefly, then recesses respectfully into thread.

=== node: bedroom_b_windowsill_marks ===
Three parallel grooves weathered smooth by fingers, or a blade, or something with patience. They point not inward or out but toward an idea about the window you decline to chase. The paint along the sill is the color of fog—somebody chose that, and you nod to the decision because taste is the last sanctuary of the haunted.

=== node: nursery_wallpaper_hares ===
If you look and think about any other thing, the hares reorder themselves into a pattern that can only be explained to a patient child. You blink and they behave; you look again and they comprise a theorem about escape.

=== node: nursery_blanket_fold ===
The blanket holds a fold as if waiting for a set of hands that has decided to be late. You smooth it and it stays smoothed, which is rarer than people admit.

=== node: nursery_rocking_horse_gouge ===
Along the rocker’s curve a crescent is bitten from the grain, a wound from a night that was either merrier or more important than it should have been. You place a thumb there and feel the shape fit you in the old way that wood does.

=== node: library_lamp_soot ===
The lamp’s glass chimneys are collared with respectable soot. You rub a thumb along one and come away with a black that refuses to be merely dirt; it is the residue of evenings, arguments, and the word “again.” The smell up close is sweet in the way accidents are sweet when forgiven. You have, for an instant, the stupid conviction that the lamp has watched something come and go in this room and learned to keep its wick low when it does.

=== node: library_index_card ===
The card has a small square of darker paper where a thumb insisted it knew the author’s initial by feel. The type is uneven and therefore endearing; someone had a ribbon and made it serve beyond its contract. The drawer closes with a sigh that would be unkind if it did not feel so much like affection.

=== node: library_latch_click ===
Press along the skirting and a catch answers in a dialect of tin. The click is tidy, a sound built by a craftsman who understood suspense. You let the panel remain because the room offers you this mercy: not every door needs opening today.

=== node: master_wardrobe_left ===
The left door swings with the authority of hinges that have practiced since the First Consul. Dresses sleep under muslin; a shawl naps upon the shoulder of a rumor. A lavender sachet releases a small cloud that declines to apologize. You draw the door shut and it accepts the correction.

=== node: balcony_loose_picket ===
When you tug the loose picket it answers with a creak so articulate you feel you should draft minutes. Rust freckles the nail in a pattern that can only be read as admonition. You leave it be, deciding that courage and prudence deserve equal holidays.

=== node: boiler_valve_handle ===
You test the valve’s handle and it resists until dignity requires it to pretend it decided to move. Somewhere a pipe answers with a depth that makes you briefly honest with your heart about how little it wants to be here. The handle returns to its starting point, which is not quite the same as balance but will pass under the circumstances.
